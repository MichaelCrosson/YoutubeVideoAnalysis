What do audiophiles and audio engineers think about the Nothing Ear and Nothing Ear (a) wireless Bluetooth earbuds?

We share our thoughts on the ‚Äã‚Å†@NothingTechnology Ear and Nothing Ear (a), the factors influencing what makes a good and bad earbud, what does and doesn't matter in an earbud, and more. You'll learn about audio from this discussion and first impressions review of the Nothing Ear and Nothing Ear (a).

CORRECTION: The Sony LinkBuds S DO allow you to use each earbud independently. We originally thought this was a bug with LDAC, but it appears to be a limitation of the ""Auto Play (Beta)."" I personally don't think this feature is worth losing the ability to use each earbud independently, so I would not enable it.

wireless home security camera which has just launched in the UK, this 
Is the BLINK XT2.  I have heard a lot of great things about Blink but when I found out about this NEW XT2 model, I just could not wait to get my hands on it, to find out exact how good it really is. A single camera system costs only ¬£99.99 but what makes Blink special is how they provide some amazing premium features all included in that initial low price, so nothing extra to pay afterwards.  Now I have in front of me the triple whammy. It's 3 camera system cost only ¬£259, so its great that you can actually save some money by buying a multiple camera pack to begin with. So without any further ado, lets just get the box open and see what it looks like.

2 Year Battery life (AA)
Two Way Audio System
