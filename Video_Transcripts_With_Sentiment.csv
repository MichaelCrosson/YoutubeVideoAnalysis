@Mrwhosetheboss,Diamond,neIYdLysqlk,I tested the Craziest Xiaomi Gadgets!,you probably know xiaomi for their suspiciously good value smartphones but what you might not have known is the sheer number of other gadgets they make I'm talking smart pillows 3D printers even smart water guns and they're all incredibly well-rated so it's time to test these for ourselves are they actually just the best value for money gadgets that we're not using yet so let's start with xiaomi's motion sensor NightLight which I men get for $9 and honestly this feels like such a win I've used a lot of motion lights before but never built like this so instead of the light being the thing that sticks onto your surface it's the stand that sticks onto the surface and then your light just magnetically attaches to the stand which is absolutely amazing because it means if you wanted to put this motion light on a bedside table put it like this if you wanted to clip it to a wall using its side you clip it like this if you wanted to put onto your ceiling facing downward you clip it like this so I'm going to see how close I need to get to get to that light for it to turn on what on Earth I must be at least 5 me away from it that is easily two times the range of any other NightLight I've used this is actually so perfect for either drawers that get a little bit too dark or just sticking it in a bathroom so that when you got to go at night you can see without vaporizing your retinas by turning on your main light look at this you can even mess around with the settings on the xiaomi app so this is how bright the light gets this is how long the light stays lit up for after it's been triggered that is actually a complete steal for $9 I think we're going to get one of these for every bedroom in the house 9.5 out of 10 moving up to $30 now this is the company's portable electric kettle which is quite a unique idea I don't think I've ever seen something quite like it before so it's like a thermos it keeps your warm drinks warm they're claiming for about 6 hours but the interesting thing is that when you plug the thing in it turns into a kettle that can actually do the boiling thing so minimalized I can't find the onr oh it's doing it and it's really fast you can actually see it climbing pretty much every second so the temperature increase does start to slow down as it reaches boiling point it's getting there but it's taking just as long to boil one cup of water as a normal Kettle would take to boil like four I mean it's quite well thought out you know it's got steam vents here which you do want with a kettle I love the fact that it has a screen on it and it actually does add value and apparently I really hope this works it doesn't leak when it's upside down or shaking around in your backpack please work I saw one robe droplet which to be fair this temperature could be enough to cause a problem I don't know this product feels like a bit of a Miss to me cuz like you wake up in the morning you make your coffee at home you take it to work and it's still hot because it's in your thermos so why do you need it to be a kettle I mean maybe if you live on your own this would be quite a nice size just to boil enough water for one person but then only if you never plan on having friends over it's not even like you can use it for camping cuz where are you going to get a main socket from feels like a 5 out of 10 to me very competent I just don't get it now let's skip ahead of it all the way to the xiaomi 3D printer just so that we can get this bad boy running while we test the other products and I have got to say that looks really cool so you might know that the vast majority of basic home 3D printers are filament printers which means you load them up with plastic they have a heater which melts that plastic deposits it in its new Arrangement and then that plastic dries as it calls but this uses liquid resin cartridges yeah chic confirm definitely not solid so you load this resin into the machine and if you look closely you'll see the machine is peppered with tiny little bulbs those emit ultraviolet light which causes a chemical reaction in this resin fluid and that causes this resin to solidify in position and this is meant to be better than filament printers in a lot of ways because it can create 3D objects without that horrible wiry finish that you get from the way that filament printers work so let's find a model that we like the look of oh this is cool actually get it to print a vase oh doesn't this look just adorable oh wow so you can fully preview the 3D model of the thing that you're about to print before you hit go just to make sure you're happy with it from every angle oh my God it actually shows you all the supporting structures that it's going to have to build as well to create that model and it's highlighted them in Gray so you know the bits that you're going to have to snap off once the model's made as well as giving you like a full Dimension map of the model this is actually so consumer friendly for what can often be a very complex and daunting process I guess that means print says open a window that's not really going to be an option in here oh really cool mechanism for this self adjusting arm oh look it's bubbling away so it's releasing resin into the chamber I have a feeling this is going to take a little bit of time to make so we'll come back to this now this one is easily one of xiaomi's most well-received products ever I've heard a lot about this considering it's a cordless screwdriver which also happens to be the winner of the if design award oh moly I mean I'm not a massive hey come look at my toolbox kind of guy but this I can see the appeal of it's so pretty it charges via USBC which is absolutely awesome compared to the micro USB or Worse still proprietary battery packs that some others use it's really clean you can't actually fittingly I suppose see a single screw in sight on the design and I love the way that it stores these little drill bits the only thing that concerns me is doesn't sound all that powerful actually let's test Theory so this is a cabinet we were assembling earlier for the house and this is about as strenuous a task as I've needed a screwdriver before yes construction is my passion the drill bits magnetically clip onto the screwdriver and then when you hold the trigger while it's in neutral you get a ring light so that your screws are twitch stream ready and then you flip the dial to the right screw stuff in and then you flick it to the left to you unscrew stuff so I guess if I want to take this out this is like child to play for it this honestly feels like another easy 9 out of 10 it is every single thing that a screwdriver needs to be for 95% of people apart from being able to stand up on its own why did I do that but clearly xiaomi was not done cooking because after this thing came out and it was such a success they went ahead and topped it with the Precision screwdriver which looks an awful lot like a power bank on a capture this satisfaction on camera it's like the feeling when you're really thirsty and you crack open an ice cold can of coat and then on the inside the Precision screwdriver is well a lot thinner it's as the name suggests more precise so you could use this to take apart a watch or a smartphone and it lasts even longer this thing does 180 screws per charge which is already enough for like an entire home's worth of Ikea furniture this can do 400 every single one of these draw bits magnetically attaches into the case oh show me it's fair to say these will be the screwdrivers that we keep around the new house I feel like I could write with this probably actually could oh yeah y you can so far at least I got to say this stuff is really good I actually think I like xiaomi's gadgets more than I like their phones but let's see if that continues with these smart laser measure so first impression the hardware is very much like the screwdriver in that it feels like it's exactly what it needs to be and nothing more so the whole thing is one button you put the measure somewhere you tap that one button it fires out a laser and then a receiver sitting on the measure will tell you how far away that laser stops okay so 0.563 okay tape me hey so I'm getting that as 0.56 2 A2 is bang on you can then double tap that button and it changes whether you're including the length of the body or just measuring from the end which is quite important because let's say you're trying to measure the length of a wall and the way that you're doing that is by placing this on one of the ends then to get the full me of the wall you would need to include however much space this takes up PR yes you are 1.58 M away from you right now okay I'm going to keep going back you're oh yeah you're 4.47 8 m from me right now it's God thing is the range is actually enormous this thing can actually measure anything up to 40 m away and it's only now that I'm realizing just how far that actually is you'd never need more than that that's awesome Jo do you want to know how far away you are from me you are 1.85 3 m from me what you going to say tall and not like not far off one they yeah still a gr lad this is all good stuff sure but the question on my mind is what makes this a smart laser measure the xiaomi app this is actually really cool because the xiaomi app that controls this is the same xiaomi app that also connects to the motion lights and just about every other xiaomi product also look at this there must be like 100 different categories of products in here and if I click on just one of them like water heaters oh my God this this say water heaters anyways what does it allow you to do on this so you can store your measurements I guess that's handy and how you can attach labels to those measurements so that you can refer back to them at any time you share your measurements with your friends I'll do everyone's shaking their heads at me so it's got a calculator oh it allows you to input all of your previous measurements taken on this and add them subtract them multiply them divide them to get fast calculations of let's say the area of the room you're measuring yeah really clever drawing measurements oh my God whoa wait so so if I take a measurement oh my God this is so cool so all the measurements I've ever taken with this are at the bottom here and I can just draw lines and then assign those lines to the measurements I've taken it builds the top down view of the room you're trying to measure and it's exactly to scale I feel like a lot of this stuff is not hard to implement once you've had the idea to implement it but it's the fact that they've had the idea and crammed it into such a minimalist device that requires no thought to use that's the impressive part I have no notes this is a 10 out of 10 product what not the first 10 you've ever given maybe xiaomi smart clock is another product that if it is actually good could well be perfect for this house it could even be a permanent main stay on our bedside tables so at its call it's a clock tells the time if you hold down on the clock you get 10 different clock V to choose from and then within each one you can customize the colors of them do you know what's particularly impressive about this though is how smooth the interface is like actually slicker than most phones at $50 and then all these other screens are other basic smartphone like features for example weather traffic calendar music from Spotify scroll down play music okay music on Spotify okay I mean it's not a Hi-Fi speaker but there's plenty of thump here you could happily listen to your morning tunes and not be upset let's try something a little more challenging hey turn light on that was easy turn off the light that's not bad at all H so actually quite capable smart home functionality too you're getting a lot of product here for something that doesn't really cost a whole lot more than like this not to mention the ritual like routines you can set so for example I can set off an entire a chain reaction just by saying good morning good afternoon the time is 3:30 p.m. currently in ilford it's 15° and cloudy today it'll be cloudy here's a joke to start your morning what do you get when you put a vest on an alligator an investigator have a great day makes me want to go back to sleep oh so welcome to my morning routine guys the only real downside is I would say the display it's LCD not OLED so unlike a modern top end OLED screen which will make black pixels completely black this thing will still emit a little bit of a glow at night still it does everything that it's trying to do really quite capably 8.5 out of 10 at $75 now we have xiaomi's monitor light bar which is super interesting to me because we have a really clear point of reference back in the old house I used to use a monitor light bar by then Q I talked a lot about how much I loved it in my perfect desktop video but this xiaomi one is less than half the price of it so if it actually is just as good then Game Changer so the reason that I love these lights so much is because unlike normal desk lamps they don't take up any desk space they don't need a means plug they just use the USB on the back of your monitor and they are specifically designed to just light up your desk avoiding both your eyes and your screen so as not to introduce glare that's actually really satisfying I love this little thing I will say this wireless remote is a little bit on the light side which means that it's not completely stable on a flat surface unlike the Ben q1 but you've got to love how aggressively minimalist the thing is you can't see a single button and the controls are as simple as just rotate the dial to adjust your level of brightness and then press and rotate to adjust the color temperature that said there are two really important features that I'm realizing this doesn't have that my BenQ light did one that even though you can change your color temperature here the old light used to actually do that automatically throughout the day so when you're working during the day you have lots of blue light to keep you awake and then in the evenings you have less of it so that you can start to wind down and that light also had a second light on the back to shine onto the wall behind your monitor which further reduces your IE strain by equalizing the brightness of the scene you're looking at so I would say there is a place for this product if you just want a really clean desk lamp but it's not the full shebang 6 out of 10 let's just check on this 3D printer copy wow that is so cool it looks like Shrek emerging from the swamp and it's saying it is 67% done not long to go now so far with all these affordable xiaomi products I think it's fair to say the value for money has been absolutely insane but now that we're going into the $100 plus luxury tier with their perfume dispenser my question is does the value for money start to deteriorate so again I will say they have knocked it out the park when it comes to design so it's powered by plugging it into your car's USB port and to be honest the cable being so short and thin kind of disappears it's very elegant I love how this just like every other Gadget here has a USBC connector and the glowing ring that shows you which scent is currently being released oh la la so green is meant to be freshness it kind of smells like walking through the forest just after it's rained in a nice way purple is meant to be soothing does this smell like body soap smells really like a hotel does it does it smells like a it smells like a hotel lobby yeah says checkin that's what this is and then orange is meant to be Joy I think it smells like oranges oh look you can see it it's got a like wispy little performance here o wow okay yeah it's actually kind of potent really full of joy I got to say it's a pretty smart little Gadget while it's on it will sporadically release scent and then stop and then release more as it's needed it will remember what setting you left it on when you turn the car off and on again I way prefer the idea of something like this as opposed to the little hanging trees people get here or whatever the hell this thing is can I check the capacity of the cartridges oh yeah look so it's telling me they're all on 100% right now we actually left this running outside for an hour yesterday and so the fact that it's still saying 100% makes me think this will last quite a long time so this to me feels unlike some other xiaomi products not the cheap way of doing things this is like the most expensive way possible to perfume your car but do you still get what you pay for yes absolutely this is one sexy way to make your car smell good 8.5 out of 10 now the massage gun is another chance for xiaomi to make something just as good for L considering that this thing is $120 whereas some massage guns I've used are $500 ooh this is some nice crinkly plastic let's give it a peel wow that was not nearly as satisfying as it should have been first thing that occurs to me it's actually kind of cool that xiaomi's design language is so consistent that the massage gun B basically just looks like a scaled up version of their screwdriver just you know don't get them mixed up you got three different heads you got a ball head that's somewhat cushioned you got a flat head and then you so it's meant to have a super quiet brushless [Music] motor oh yeah I I can't even why do you need this fair play though it is very quiet considering what it's able to do although not so much when you start to turn the settings up wow that's amazing though it's almost like it's reaching ultrasonic speeds it's actually going so fast that I don't even feel like I'm getting peled anymore I just feel like really deep releas but then also it has a smart pressure sentor built in so you actually have to push a certain amount till it lights up white which means that you're pushing the right am out and then it's meant to go red when you're putting in too much but ow ow there's got to be the limit tell me to stop that point I might as well just use the screwdriver so the ball head will definitely be more forgiving than than whatever this is so if I use that instead I should be able to show the pressure sensing ah see that's nice so you can see when I put a normal amount of pressure on it goes weight and then when I put too much pressure it will eventually come out [Music] okay well I would probably discount the smart pressure sensor as a feature you'll be banking on and that's basically it it's fairly simple but it's not exactly lacking in features I know some high-end th guns have like red light therapy and a proper screen to allow you to configure your settings completely but this does actually feel just as high quality and the massage it gives you is very much as thorough which is an achievement for something a quarter of the price and also the heat dissipation mechanism here is completely concealed so nothing gets inside of this even if you get a little sweaty while using it can't think why that might be it's actually kind of crazy because this xiaomi massage gun is actually less expensive than like a Theon mini and this gives you a far better massage than this does it's just that i' still probably prefer to use this on the regular because this actually fits into a small side pocket of my backpack the xiaomi does not so I'll go an 8 out of 10 bolstered by the fact that it has an insane 13 hours of battery life now on first burns the sh we pillow doesn't look like a product that even belongs in a tech video it is very soft like genuinely this might be the comfiest pillow I've ever interacted with but when you look at it it's not particularly clear what makes it smart I it's got this weird alien looking dongle thing coming out of it but that's because almost the entirety of the pillow's functionality is based on the app so the thing's got a bunch of absolutely tiny millimeter scale sensors baked inside of it to measure changes in pressure temperature strain and and acceleration for anyone who's training for a marathon in their sleep I guess and it basically uses all these sensors to give you almost all of the same data that you would get from an Apple Watch or an aura ring or a whoop band while being more affordable and also very comfy with its zero cotton material made with a natural vegetable oil extract is that vegetable by any chance spring onion it anyways I actually tested it last night so I slept on this and I also wore the Apple Watch series 10 at the same time so let's compare statistics oh dear so the Apple watch is saying I slept for 8 hours and 40 minutes and it says I fell asleep at yeah 16 midnight that seems about right the xiaomi pillow is telling me I slept 6 hours and 26 and that I was awake until 3:00 a.m. no I wasn't okay so given that I've tested this quite a bit and it has been accurate in the past and given that I do not remember being awake for the first 3 hours of my sleep I don't think it would be very wise to trust the answers this thing gives you but at the same time man when I look at the xiaomi app and I see the thousands of products that can all neatly tie together into this one ecosystem it is so tantalizing the idea that I could have a smart pillow that when I wake up in the morning directly communicates to my smart blinds to tell them to open without even needing any kind of middle layer because they're part of this one app is so cool but yeah not too sure about this particular pillow 4 out of 10 now I've tested quite a few water guns in my time cheap guns fancy guns but never one quite as ridiculous as xiaomi I'm struggling to wrap my head around how a water gun can be worth $250 so let's get testing oh it charges with USBC of course nice turn it on wa I didn't realize that's an LED stroke that is so cool so then you stick it in the water you push the trigger forward instead of back you can actually see the water filling up using the Neds room that's such a clever way to use what would otherwise be a gimmick oh yeah and then the screen also tells you how much of your water tank is full probably got outside so obviously it is cooler than every other water gun but is it actually better cuz I just bought this for $15 and it's still electric I'm just going to shoot drisha this the second time that I've been shot in a video yeah but see so we've moved house and I left the kind of dummy at home that I was going to use and I don't do this for me I do this for the content okay so where would you like to be you know you can choose choose where you'd like to be [Music] anywhere thank you for offering yourself for this cause Okay so this is a normal water gun it looks like it's barely reaching you yeah it's like a like a garden sprinkler but to be fair rate of fire impressive I'll just carry on trying to and that's basically it for this gun there's no alternate fire modes I mean technically there's an optical scope I don't think it's going to get you very far so that leads us to this so first thing you notice is a display like an actual fairly high resolution circular display and that shows you the fire mode you're on so if I click this rather unusually named mode Swit button on the side it will take me between single fire mode and burst fire mode so same distance you tell me how much you feel this okay okay I felt that one you felt that 0 to 10 I I felt that like an an eight okay like an eight so let me try burst fire oh God okay okay okay that's pretty cool like a water bullet I think it's definitely coming apart as it's approaching you so it's not like when you pay $250 for a water gun you're suddenly getting sniper like accuracy at a distance so from what I've understood if I now hold down the trigger I can actually charge up a super bullet of sorts okay let's see so hold down You See This Bar filling up tells me I'm ready to go okay okay it feels like I should feel the impact cuz it's coming so fast yeah it's just yeah it just kind of sprays out yeah it's not significantly more powerful yeah all I'm getting okay it's getting it it's definitely more powerful it's getting more it's more powerful that's all I want Sor I'm trying to avoid your microphone it feels like the kind of product that is so far beyond what you would normally expect to pay for a water gun that this isn't about being good value for money it's not good value for money it's if you want the best of the best this is that 8 out of 10 a look whoa what are you doing up there buddy that looks incredibly cursed so you meant to unscrew this pull it out like so I got swamp on my hand [Music] wow and we're left with the cutest fell you've ever seen now there are two downsides I can think of one that you've got to use these xiaomi only proprietary single use resin cartridges after which you throw them which it's not particularly environmentally friendly but then also it smells really bad I've actually been holding my nose for the last 45 seconds and we're probably going to need some industrial great stuff to clean this room up still though this is a way better result than I've ever seen come from a filament printer 8 and now for the flagship Big Daddy xiaomi product this is the one that I'd say xiaomi has the biggest Market penetration in the electric scooter I see these things all the time on the screets but this is their new scooter 4 Pro and my clumsiest unboxing ever oh there we go again nearly face planted the first thing you notice is this is quite a bit taller than the average electric scooter which is great for me because I'm usually ever so slightly trained over and also the base feels wider it's like the extra leg room seats on a plane let's take it for a spin I'm a little scared for the acceleration holy wow I've tested electric scooters before never before with that much oomph oh I'm A Hazard To Myself and Society with this so I know that the speed of electric scooters is capped in most countries for your own safety that doesn't mean this thing can't accelerate and then when you run out of battery this is another massive Improvement the charger is magnetic which is really important for something so valuable because it means if you accidentally walk on by it that nearly hit you I'm sorry your scooter is still standing I mean the thing even has regenerative braking which is what electric cars use to recover some of their energy when you hit the brakes which is what's actually increasing this thing's range from 45 km last generation to 55 km this generation squeeze me w I mean this wo has to be the most polished refined high-tech electric scooter out there even the lights on the front and the back are extremely bright there's reflectors all over for visibility on roads and it's just such a smooth ride and part of the reason why is these tires they're bigger which is good for shock absorption but they're also made of dura gel that's apparently also self-sealing if you get a puncture what as if I needed to make this any more hazardous for myself this is a plank of wood with with a 2in nail sticking out of it all right off we go oh this could be rip okay that's definitely in there let's go back over let really make sure it's done this is why we can't have nice things here well actually I suppose we can just temporarily I think it's fair to say that's tested [Music] so well there's just nothing here so whether the tire has actually broken and self-repaired without me even realizing or has just absorb the entire impact of that nail without even puncturing that is one durable piece of Kit so I got to say I'm personally more of a bike person I like the idea of if I'm not using a car and having the most convenient way to get somewhere then at least I'm getting some exercise while I'm at it but if you're looking for a scooter then this is everything it needs to be and more 10 out of 10 and I will catch you in the next one woohoo oh my God,you probably know xiaomi for their suspiciously good value smartphones but what you might not have known is the sheer number of other gadgets they make I'm talking smart pillows 3D printers even smart water guns and they're all incredibly well-rated so it's time to test these for ourselves are they actually just the best value for money gadgets that we're not using yet so let's start with xiaomi's motion sensor NightLight which I men,-0.126,1.0,0.9598
@Mrwhosetheboss,Diamond,YX8ks42Azn8,The TRIPLE FOLDING phone has a Problem.,"this right here is the Huawei mate XT I spent over $5,000 to get one it's the world's first triple folding phone the thing is kind of mind-blowing but as I've started to dig deeper I realized there is also something sinister going on with it so this is how the thing comes presented iPhone box size reference W there's no doubt about it this is absolutely incredible so right on top here are the Huawei free buds 5 I gave these things a 7 out of 10 when I tested all the band Huawei products got a car charger 8 watts pluming NE that's generous but then I suppose equally at the same time this is the kind of experience that you would expect anyone who's willing to pay thousands of dollars for a first generation product is a true fan and Huawei needs to make sure that those fans are looked after so in here we got tips for the earphones a bunch of papers and then a carbon fiber case okay we'll come back to this what's in here oh what so you got the mains charger which is only 66 WS how do you have a Mains charger with less power than the car charger and not one but two cables a USBC to USBC and then a USBC to usba a now before the whole we didn't even need onefold why on Earth would we need twofold Army comes to get me hear me out because there is something I think is absolutely amazing about this ever since the very first foldable phones we have had a problem I think it's fair to say that most people are interested in the idea of a phone that could become a tablet at the snap of their fingers a massive screen to watch movies or play your games on but the reason that very few people follow through and actually buy these folding phones like the ones from Samsung is price aside if you want to make it usable while it's folded it's got to be tall like a phone but then that means that when you open it it's got to be square and because videos and games are all designed to be widescreen it barely makes your experience bigger than just using a normal phone and so the only thing left for foldable is to be better at crazy multitasking but that's Niche and just be honest most people who could afford one of these already have a laptop or a proper tablet for that anyway but that is where this Huawei comes in so you open once from here and yeah in this form it is basically the same as a normal foldable AKA pretty useless for most types of content but look what happens when we open one more time the extra width from this one extra fold is an absolute GameChanger I mean like this is an iPad it's widely considered one of the best devices for catching up with your m movies on an airplane but now we have a phone that gives you practically the same viewable screen area when watching content except this one folds into something resembling this what year are we living in and what Huawei has done to achieve this is actually just as cool so this is Samsung zold 5 and when folded it is 13.4 mm thick Samsung's very latest is 12.1 mm huawei's triple folding phone is just 12.8 they've crumbed in a whole extra layer this is like 2D versus 3D while barely making the phone thicker at all and what that means is when the thing is unfolded this is 3.6 mm thick obviously it is easier to make things thinner when you have more space this way but 3.6 I did a video a few years ago on the thinnest smartphone in the world and that was 4.75 and the current iPhone is 8.3 for reference it genuinely feels like some sort of sci-fi movie prop and I can't quite believe this is a final product you know where it really hits home just how slim this is is when you realize that every single port button and cutout looks like it barely fits on the device not to mention that you can really tell they've put some love into this design like can you see this gold accent ring around the camera well that is apparently handd designed with almost 80 layers of stacked steel very much like actually those highly prized Damascus knives and what it means is that every single phone looks just a little bit different and that's cool so is this what foldable phones should have been like all along is this what Samsung should be making starting from next year Well it certainly looks that way on first glance cuz let's say that I'm using a normal bold folding phone I could use it in one hand like this I could use it in two hands like this or I could use it on a table and it's half folded state but what can you do on this well for starters you've got the normal phone mode you got the screen on the front you got the camera on the back this is effectively the same as using a normal folded phone folded up so then you open it up and again functionally at this point we are still identical with what you get with a normal folding phone and also like a normal folding phone you can use the screen that's currently facing the back to allow the person you're shooting to see themselves and also to allow you to take high quality selfies using your phone's rear set of cameras damn that looks good but then you get the third screen involved and this way you can start to do some very interesting stuff like you can use two screens to watch what you're doing while using the third screen to angle your camera you could actually have two screens to work on and then use the bottom screen folded up like that as a stand and then you add this case into the mix which in itself already has a stand that can rotate to any angle that you want it to and you start to think to yourself I can use this phone however I can think to use this phone this is what I mean when I say that the extra screen here is like the difference between 2D and 3D because the possibilities aren't just additive they are multiplicative and they've managed to do all of this without even sacrificing on the cameras I mean you can probably tell by the fact that this camera bump is half the thickness of the phone but this is on the upper end of foldable phone cameras and even though it is somewhat early days on the software like not that many things are fully optimized for three screens it does feel like they have thought about the user experience like for example when you want to unlock the pin screen comes up on the side that you swipe up with so this is interesting enough that yes I would love to see what Samsung and xiaomi and other foldable firm makers can do with this type of form factor cuz while it does create a number of issues in itself they're all solvable and what it does is it fixes the one big one and actually makes foldables useful for the masses now that is not to say that Huawei gets a free pass because while the trifold design could work this specific attempt at one does not I mean the smaller issues are already something there's the fact that yes there is absolutely a honeymoon phase with this where you wake up every day with a spring in your step you turn over to your wife sorry phone you open it and you Marvel at how on Earth Huawei fit this much device into 3.6 mm of thickness when unfolded but as the days go on you come to another realization that because this thing is now twice as much effort to unfold you're going to end up using it a lot more just like this and when you use it folded up like this you're basically just holding a brick phone that happens to weigh 300 G cuz even though the thing isn't much thicker than normal phones it's the hinges having to have two hinges on this means that a higher proportion of the device has to be made of densely compacted metal and speaking of hinges they don't fold both ways so the front folds outwards whereas the rear folds inwards and if you get that wrong even once with a little too much pressure well it will still fold just irreversibly I've seen this happen enough times that I have decided I won't be the guy who tries it and it ain't just the hinges you also have to be very careful with the screen folding phone screens are much easier to scratch than normal phone screens and there are lots of situations when using this where you have to to expose some parts of this pressure screen to the elements and on that note how precious well you know that I paid $5,000 which is obviously not the retail price of this thing it's the I managed to scalp one and sell it on eBay for profit price but even the retail price in China where it's mainly on sale is $22,800 or $3,400 for the top spec model and because this screen is such a unique component the repair costs for this piece alone are $11,000 and even when you're not looking after the screens you're looking at the creases on them do you notice they're actually not the worst we've seen but by no means invisible well that's partly because when you add more hinges you can't make each hinge as good a good hinge that doesn't crease the display takes up valuable space and since the entire priority here is to compress the design as much as possible something's got to give but as I was saying all of these issues potentially solvable and to be fair expected when you're trying something that's this different none of this stuff makes this phone a write off there is a deeper Huawei problem and I'm not even talking about the over 50 pre-installed apps or the fact that if you want to do literally anything Google you have to do it via one of these Shady applications that try to convince Google you're not coming from a Huawei phone like the most common one is Gbox which signs into Google by identifying as a Samsung Galaxy a22 I know because I got the email confirmation for it here's the thing if you've watched any Huawei launch events recently you'll have seen that Richard U who leads them keeps saying that Huawei is far ahead of its competitors this company feels hyper aware of what Apple and Samsung are doing and wants to make it very publicly clear to Chinese citizens that those companies are slacking in comparison and you might look at something like this and say you know what actually yeah I don't see Samsung's trifold phone even if they have already used the letter z for a phone that looks nothing like a z Hua is ahead but I think the reason they're doing this is because this is all they can do see the Huawei us band in 2019 completely crippled this company cutting off access to their suppliers from all around the world basically means that in some ways huawei's Tech has frozen in time like look at this the chip that powered huawei's P10 this is their 2017 flagship phone is based off a 16 nanm fabrication process the lower that number the better cuz it basically means the chip is more efficient so let's look at next year the P20 Pro wow huge Improvement 16 nanm all the way down to 10 NM and again with the next phone the P30 Pro 10 nanm all the way down to 7 this is the year the US band struck and if you look at Huawei phones since then in 5 years they haven't actually managed to move past 7 nanom now don't get me wrong huawei's chips have been refined since then they are better but it's just that the Baseline Tech is now far behind the rest of the world and I think this is huawei's way around that to not really talk about the chips or the rest of the tech like the storage speeds that are also stuck in the past but instead to try and come across like they're not behind but actually still ahead by creating a new design otherwise it might start to look like they're just releasing the same phones again and again and clearly is working I mean this thing has racked up over 7 million pre-orders in China alone that's like that's like Samsung flagship phone levels of performance and it has people running around inside Apple Stores doing this whatever this is but here's what this dated China focused Tech actually means so let's try opening up Call of Duty war zone [Music] okay yeah that's actually completely dead on the loading screen okay let's try a different game so this one boots up but it's pretty clear that this isn't designed for running top tier modern applications well on a screen like this and that's not even talking about the battery which is actually quite good for a phone at 5,600 Mah hours but bad for a tablet it's like half of the capacity that you would expect so even though you have to give credit to Huawei for releasing this not even as a slightly juny concept phone but a genuinely usable consumer grade product I still wouldn't actually recommend anyone ditch their normal bar phone it's still got that slightly stuck in the middle of two things and does neither particularly well syndrome which is probably why the initial frenzy of everyone buying the things up to resell them at twice the price is starting to cool down rather quickly now let's be honest though the main reason people are buying this phone is to flex on people literally so let's use this video sponsor the insta 360 X4 camera to catch that in so here's what I think is absolutely amazing about this camera it captures every single thing around you all at once in 8k resolution by the way so you don't need to angle it you don't need to check the feed to make sure you're not missing anything all you need to do is to hold it or put it in a backpack and this is what that footage looks like it automatically gets rid of the invisible selfie stick so all you can see is this like drone floating directly in front of you perfectly locked onto you but the software is the best bit cuz let's say that you're looking through the footage afterwards and you catch something that you want to follow like in this case this person looking at me like the fool that I am acting as you can literally just tap on their face and your camera tracks them automatically after you've already taken your video and if you don't want to do any editing at all there's even an AI button that automatically selects the best bits for you link below to get yourself the X4 with a exclusive 10% discount as well as a free 3 m selfie stick to get your own drone like shots like this","this right here is the Huawei mate XT I spent over $5,000 to get one it's the world's first triple folding phone the thing is kind of mind-blowing but as I've started to dig deeper I realized there is also something sinister going on with it so this is how the thing comes

@Mrwhosetheboss,Diamond,4RcThoRG46c,I tested every Celebrity Tech product!,"in front of me right now are VTech products made by the world's biggest celebrities everything from smart watches that replace your smartphone to microphones that make you sing better to Cyclone powerered popcorn machines so have these celebrities used their special talents to make something genuinely amazing or have they actually just abused their Fame to sell you a load of hot garbage time to find out with our lovely homemade ratings chart and let's actually go in order of how famous the person is starting with Will I Am who already has a very respectable 1.6 million Instagram followers and he has made a smartwatch called the dial holy cow this packaging is amazing it looks like a floor standing speaker and here is the watch why does it look like a handcuff now the key selling point here is that this thing has full smartphone functionality and it runs on a voice activated oper ow it's got such a strong magnet it just ripped off my arm it runs off a voice activated operating system called an needer like I needer un Ely I need a network connection to help you first name I need a second name connection the actual interface is fine enough I guess it looks somewhat slick and like a smart watch but it's pretty clear the core functionality rests on it communicating with some sort of server that I am pretty certain the dude's just taken down to be fair the quality isn't terrible for a watch camera it's just the colors need some work I look like a Simpson I'm honestly not surprised it barely works to be honest it it looks like it doesn't even listen to Will I Am himself let's talk about music do you feel like eating but before we decide how low will he go on our beautiful scoreboard we've got two more products from the guy first the super mask designed I guess to be the Batman utility belt of face masks okay so it's got a silicon seal that goes over your nose it's got LED lights on the outside two three-speed ventilation fans and noise cancelling bluetooth earbuds that magnetically dock onto the mask when not in use to broadcast your ear wax to the people sitting on either side of you there's a slightly bigger problem here this mask is on its tightest setting right now the one product where it's absolutely vital that you create a complete seal and yet there were two different sizes there was small medium and then medium large but between those two options I'm firmly in the camp of medium large Joseph can I just check I'm not being an idiot here course so that's the tightest possible setting yes see if it fits [Music] you no in the nicest way possible how large would you say your head is uh all my loved ones in my entire life I said have got a fat head I always go for the extra large and the minimal padding in helmets if you wore the straps higher up then does it fit no cuz then you got a massive Gap here how do they make a face mask that doesn't mask your face I'm starting to get the feeling that everyone's favorite pandemic doctor will I am doesn't completely think things through and finally we've got his earphones called the buttons which unlike basically every single other set of earphones that do everything they can to hide themselves these are designed to like the buttons on your clothing specifically be on show they're meant to be the way for you to show the world you love music by looking a lot like vinyl records which also happen to snap together with magnets dude what is it with this guy and the insistence on showing people the insides of your ears so will I am is is not so bril I am I'm going to give you a three mostly for the effort oh wow this this one looks a lot more budget than I was expecting it to this is the IMT pain microphone and it's oh it's packaged in that horrible sharp plastic I guess so you can really feel with te pain but this is actually a pretty cool product idea because even if you have no idea who Tain is I think there's a pretty good chance that you've heard tain's voice at some point it is famously autotuned like so autotuned that I have no idea what he sounds like without the autotune and so this can apparently give that power to you oh God I hate this although I'm actually the perfect candidate to test this with because I cannot sing so there's a record button [Music] here now click play okay interesting it's time to whip it out what I'm actually really upset that you're going to hear my before singing as well as my after we've known each other for so long this a big moment right here play we've known each other for so long I will take that that's the first time I've ever heard myself singing where I don't want to run and hide myself under my bed in silence for the next week there's another button here which apparently allows you to drop a dirty background track [Music] we've known each other for so long all right we've known each other for so long you know what I actually like it no one would ever use this to record real music but it's a lot of fun and then when you're done press these two buttons pull that off and this is a USB port so you can download to your computer the files of you singing so this is the trailer for The Product hey knock off that racket I will turn this car around everything sounds better with the IMT pain mic you kids now play Boom hey still noise one button te pain effect I am T and I approve this me so it's not just for performances this is also a child discipline tool t p is a marketing genius so Mr Tay not a professional piece of equipment but does what it says on the tin which is more than we can say for some 5 out of 10 all the way up at 7.1 million Instagram followers now we've got Fernando Alonso who depending on what you're into is either going to be a massive deal or you have no idea who I'm talking about Alonso is a Spanish Formula 1 World Champion currently driving for Aston Martin but I love how he's put carting world champion before F1 in his bio guy's got his priorities straight and so what he's done is built a Lifestyle brand called kimoa off the back of his racing career and in what might be the most fitting product for a Formula 1 racing driver to make this is their version of an e scooter at kimoa we believe that life perseveres within regardless of what occurs externally this is why we love the Sun the Sea and the light because they reflect a way of being just as the sun rises internally each day tell me you've used chat gbt without telling me you've used chat gbt doesn't exactly scream unique products that have had lots of love put into them though I do have an idea of where we can test this we'll get to it oh this one's fun so for some baffling reason soundcloud's Golden Boy rapper Soldier Boy you know this guy started selling his own video game consoles in 2018 and the Pinnacle of them released in 2021 was supposed to be the solder boy game get it I think these are the cheapest feeling earphones I've ever held I remember the guy's Twitter marketing at the time this thing wasn't just being sold as a knockoff Game Boy it was advertised with a 3.5 in touchscreen Netflix Spotify and apple music right out the box and it was supposedly going to have some huge big brand big budget games including fortnite and Call of Duty long story short it became pretty clear that the legendary soldja boy game was actually just an existing gaming handheld called the trdr pocket but in red and after it turned out that it was a scam and basically no one who bought one seemed to receive one Soulja Boy then started promising those buyers that they would instead get an upgraded model with AI that was now worth $400 and this is that oh God this thing is so reflective not a good choice of finish for a gaming console so it runs Android which means oh no the Call of Duty and the fortnite games he's promised to people they're just the mobile games aren't they it doesn't even meet the minimum requirements to run fortnite fortnite on a phone does not have very high minimum requirements uh it plays the emulator okay it's not like the best visual or frame rate experience but it's it's not bad as an emulator the thing has no shoulder buttons how am I meant to drift without shoulder buttons okay forget that let's test the AI the supposedly lifechanging AI That's the sole reason this thing's price was increased from $200 to $400 hi Scarlet what's the weather tell me anything tell me anything useful it crashed maybe I can ask it to drift for me in racing game since I have no shoulder buttons this whole thing is just absolutely terrible every angle of this sucks it's Android 11 so it's 4 years out of date I have doubts about the update schedule on this device oh and I really love this Personal Touch he's added to the side of the console he's angled the power button 80° off from where it normally is what a guy does it not also look like one of those devices use in hospitals to bring people back to life like except this might actually be the thing that kills me okay so this is Call of Duty mobile none of the controls work so settings oh my God the res ution of the screen is so poor I can barely read the text in the menus it's just such a lazy product they haven't done like the base layer of programming required to make these controls detectable in most games well I guess what soldja boy said was true in life you either Crank that soldja boy or he cranks you and we're the ones you got cranked here you get a very prestigious zero out of 10 not even on the board okay we are in the tens of millions at this point I think it's pretty fair to say that anyone Beyond this point is like world famous starting with Harry Kane who's kind of a football legend this guy scored 66 goals in his 98 International appearances making him the highest goal scorer ever for England and basically meaning that in any given game he is more likely to score than to not score which feels like a wild statistic so with all his Goodwill Kane has recently launched his own brand of sustainable Electronics called our Pure Planet there's like a hundred things here from them I'm going to pick one of them let's review the speaker I got to say Kane this website feels completely dead very much like some eagle-eyed business person has seen some well-priced generic Tech from China they want to drop ship it to wealthy westerners but then realized they needed a name to push it so he said hey Harry can we borrow you for a day to do a photo shoot with them I mean every single one of these photos is shot with Harry Kane in one of two outfits so I'm now thinking 2hour photo shoot Max you know what's making me think this is it's just the fact that these products look so soulless they have no identity or consistency Beyond just this one logo so I guess if these have been designed from scratch then Harry buddy you got to get yourself a new designer oh no that is the epitome of generic startup sounds it's like they picked from the generic speaker bingo card this is just so lazy I can't believe it I don't know if you're going to get Harry Kane have him say Bluetooth mode on it would add some value have you heard him speak well I've not seen the pen back but from my point of view do look like [Music] okay so you've got one set of speakers facing this way one set facing this way so you have some directional audio it doesn't sound terrible but at the same time I have heard $30 speakers that have more detail than this nothing about this Tech feels at all worth $130 I guess the only saving grace is how much you value the sustainability they say that every single speaker is 100% carbon neutral and 200% plastic regenerative but there's always an asterisk with these things no one is saving the planet by buying speakers if you actually care about sustainability buy a used one on eBay so boring product not very good for the price you sir have earned yourself a four at 18 million followers well before he got suspended and then eventually deactivated his Instagram account it's Kanye West or I guess yay nowadays and his stem player speaker now we have actually covered one of these before in one of our gadgets videos but I think this thing is fascinating it looks like an alien it feels like a bag of skin but hidden inside is actually an artificial intelligence that can take any song and break it down into its various different stems like the Baseline drums vocals Etc allowing you to control each one of them on the Fly power it on it's actually such a cool looking product so I'm playing a song right now and you can see in real time stripping out the various individual elements so that right there is the drums that's the melody it does feel just a little bit like magic the problem though is well a it's not a good sounding speaker considering the price you pay for it it actually makes Harry kanes look like good value oh and also the only way to load music onto it is to use the stem player website which processes the track and then you have to download it and put it onto your stem player manually pretty much immediately relegating this to cool toy that you probably won't use so I was thinking a six just because of how cool the thing is but minus one point for trying to make his d 2 album exclusive to the stem player effectively charging people $200 just to listen to it now from someone who well still has Instagram it's the actress Drew Barrymore and this lady has done a lot you know the little girl in the ET movie that's her host of her own talk show that's her one of Charlie's Angels yeah still her and now add to that list owner of the company Beautiful by Drew who made this popcorn machine I got to say though not the highest quality better kit it feels like most celebrity products by default go specifically for luxury whereas this feels quite light and cheap which is fair enough it's only $34 but I guess I don't think you'll find this proudly displayed in Drew Barrymore's kitchen as her pride and joy so one measure of popcorn goes in there I actually skipped dessert today so this is kind of perfect and this also now apparently doubles as a butter melting tray yes please oh wow okay we're cooking with gas oh my goodness you can see the cyclone in action the seeds are actually rotating and this is actually the air fryer of popcorn machines I guess because instead of oil it uses cyclonic airflow technology which is the same principle that dys and fans use supposedly to maintain even cooking temperature throughout it's definitely not an immediate process it is oh wait wait uh Joseph this is smoking oh God okay I'm going to turn that off wow I think we got it working again wait why is it why is the entire thing put it in butter I wanted that on my popcorn not my machine all right we're smoking up again on the inside I'm going to call it there well I got to say pretty terrible impression of this product so far none of it has reached my bowl oh God still smells good I'll give it that melted butter oh wo then actually little top tip for homemade popcorn cinnamon butter and sugar add some of that on top all right Drew give me like five bu Mor cheers that was delicious but I take 100% of the credit that was not delicious because of Drew Barrymore and her cheaply made oil covered Transformer destroying half cooking popcorn machine drewberry 4 no two Barry more Hillary Duff is up next actress singer author and businesswoman with 26.9 million followers so she is officially ahead of our YouTube channel which I'm sure she's had a big celebration about watch out though I might just have to build world's largest Hillary Duff and her company below 60 has built their own Cent diffuser and I thought this was interesting below 60 isn't referring to degrees of temperature instead it refers to 60° south of the Equator a Latitude that encompasses only ocean near Antarctica which is supposedly where the freshest air on Earth is the website says this thing redefines fragrance design with the following features oh yeah so there's a magnet on the plug and the fragrance just snaps in place although it is leaking I mean the one job of a container is to stop it doing that okay adjustable horizontal and vertical plug so you can just take this and snap it into two different orientations which I have to say is kind of a genius idea cuz like because the scenter diffuser is kind of thick you'll want to be able to rotate it away from the plug next to it just so it doesn't obstruct it and then fragrance strength control well that's a bit of a stretch it's got high low and off so there's three different scents there's if Citrus were a feeling it's got like orange and lime and Sandalwood and spices mint disco on ice smells like a spa mixed with a candy shop so good vanilla buys a time share in Paradise H that's like a panina colada it's nice okay so the scents are like addictively good the only question on my mind is is this actually any better than a cheaper simpler and frankly more aesthetic pleasing readed diffuser in theory this is meant to gently warm your fragrances to encourage evaporation but let's come back later to find out if that's true or not Olivia Rodrigo a name you probably never heard a few years ago and now you can't stop hearing about with 37.8 million followers has collaborated with Sony to design her version of the link buds which feels like a pretty off thee beaten path cultured choice or you know Sony offered her a bucket load of cash so this whole purple exteror is her signature color U but to be very honest I don't think she's done a very good job with it maybe it was meant to look pearlescent and like a piece of jewelry but to me it just looks like a used pencil erazor at least it is using recycled materials cuz like you can tell one thing though that I think is really cool and might be able to save it is two custom sound profiles tuned by Rodrigo and her producer for the optimal listening experience of her albums guts and sour and I guess there is something really cool about knowing that you're getting the exact same audio experience that she's had and that she endorses for her own music let's give it a go so right now I'm listening to her sour album without the sour sound profile H I would say the earphones sound pretty good but they're a little bit flat they don't have the base response that I would want and also I think part of it is on her album I think it's not recorded in the best environment for optimal listening you know there's some artists who when you listen to their tracks on really good earphones you just know that they've obsessed over recording the track right let's switch over to the sour sound profile H okay I changed my mind it's actually kind of lazy they both sound basically the same as each other and they both sound almost the same as just the flat neutral sound profile so I guess the idea is cool but it's not enough to make it a unique proposition nor is it enough to make not so great earphones sound amazing so I would say it's not a scandal but she's taken a pretty mediocre product and to be honest with this design she's actually made it slightly worse so I think you can have a four wow this is actually a really poor show is anyone even going to reach the upper half now just before we get to the top three celebrities the ones with hundreds of millions of followers turns out that Will Smith is actually the global Ambassador for insta 360 this video sponsor and they have absolutely nailed it with their new X4 camera for two reasons one you know that famous bending over backward scene from The Matrix movie well they use no fewer than 120 photo cameras all around to capture every single angle equipment totaling well over $200,000 the insta 360 X4 allows you to achieve the same bullet time effect with one camera and it records that at 5.7k resolution but there is more so we give this a little Kickstart to get it going and then pull down the trigger oh oh oh oh my God Fernando uh-oh uh-oh how do you stare this how do you steare this okay abandon two the the whole benefit of 360 cameras is that they record every single angle at once so you never miss anything the downside is that this often adds an extra step cuz you might want to go through and tweak which way the camera is looking at every single point but now you don't even have to do that anymore because the AI editing will do it for you in seconds so check out the link in the description for the insta 360x 4 a 10% discount a free bullet time handle and an invisible selfie stick so the scooter is it's fun I think this is me realizing that I really like E Scooters as opposed to I really like Alonzo's product it's pretty standard like I mean there's a light which we've seen a lot of very bright flashlights on this channel this isn't really one of them and there's just not many bells and whistles to it except that one but it's got a kick oh no ram ram I think you can have our first ever six out of 10 right we're in the big leagues now with 121 million followers It's Real Madrid footballer Killian mbappe and he has also released a portable speaker but this one's very promising with 100 watts of Music power compared to I'd guess the 30 watts of Harry Kane speaker and the three watts of the speakers inside your phone holy moly the color on this thing a slightly hilarious attempt at branding on their website inspired by the sporting achievements of football star Killian mbappe we've made a speaker I mean the guy's a fantastic dribbler but how did you get to speaker from there this one is pretty exciting because the company that manufactures it is called L they're a luxury Speaker Company they have a normal Bluetooth speaker which cost 99 but then with mbappe they've worked together to design the pro which is 249 so are we being scammed or has Killian gone and scored oh this is actually super unique there's a touch bar on the actual body of the speaker that allows you to adjust the volume the base and the treble although do they not think to put a slightly brighter LED on the inside considering you can see the rest of the speaker from the moon so let's take it for a spin oh okay you really feel the the thump that comes with 100 watts of amplification here your base is going up now going all the way God uh okay so this is a good powerful speaker but it's exactly what it looks like you know when you see this Basse slider that you can adjust to some infinite degree it makes you think that it's going to be one of those speakers like the dvla Phantom that I tested a while ago that can just completely defy its Dimensions this is not that when you dial up the bass it literally just tweaks a software setting that adds in more base at the cost of everything else and it sounds kind of Muddy adjusting The Equalizer with your music is not some sort of magic trick that makes music sound better and that's all this is really but you know decent sound it's water and temperature resistant it's got 24-hour battery life it doubles as a power bank and well you're not going to lose it all right G on then 6 out of 10 basically just for doing what you say on the tin number two then is none other than Kim Kardashian we're now at levels of Fame that I don't even understand like how does one even start to get 361 million Instagram followers but anyway she has worked together with Beats by Dre to create her own custom version of The Studio Pros so she's launched this in three colors all personally curated by her called Moon Dune and Earth what is up with Kim Kardashian trying to turn the entire world flesh toned actually can't decide if I like it or not it makes it look and feel very premium but at the same time time it makes me feel like I'm carrying around a bag of foundation wherever I go and then you've also got this custom cable which weaves together the Fabrics of all three of the colors she's made so that they only have to make one cable for all three products let's give him a listen I actually haven't tested beats in a while but these are not the products they used to be they're actually easily the best sounding audio products in this entire video but don't get too excited nothing's been over a six so obviously Kim Kardashian didn't make beats but she pck a good product to partner with and she made it look better for some people so congratulations Kim you're the proud recipient of a s out of 10 oh wa that is nice not subtle at all and I love it oh yeah it's definitely warmed up which is just going to accelerate the natural evaporation process only thing that how on Earth are we already like halfway through the fragrance like when I bought this reed diffuser this was full to the brim with fragrance so that's like 10 times the volume of this little cartridge so I guess it's here for a good time not a long time yeah I could see this becoming a very expensive hobby to keep fueling but she's made her own company it's not a Rebrand of someone else's product and it does what it says on the tin better than basically any other scent diffuser I've tried so you can have a high eight not a dff you want to know who we have at the very top though it's well arguably the most famous person on the planet Cristiano Ronaldo who also happens to be the co-founder and face of consumer electronics brand Rock and also now the fastest growing YouTube channel of all time what does this say rock is more than my brand it's a reflection of my mission to live life loud okay so he's all in on this apparently and these are his earphones and so what kind of earphones does the most famous person on the planet use well I hope he uses his own earphones it'd be pretty funny if he's actually just an airpods guy although oh my goodness me this is Photoshop you can very clearly see that the earphones have been added into the image afterwards I don't think there's a single photo of him actually using these this looks like a render too well that's not a good start okay the fit is secure thanks to these fins that kind of Lodge themselves in your ears that makes sense he plays football he doesn't want them to fall out while he's running oh man that's not the best really is it this is like this is the definition of fine the thing is right it's not expensive to make decent in earphones and that is all these are they're just very Baseline in quality like even though these are priced at like $130 $140 I'm genuinely thinking $7 manufacturing cost there's nothing about the sound or the feel or the technology on offer here that makes it any more sophisticated than that they did also say that this cable has Kevlar embedded inside of it which you shouldn't be able to cut very easily sorry Ronaldo it was Zero resistance so the product works it's just grossly overpriced for what it is and also kind of misleading with the way it's marketed two out of 10 there of an own gold that one so there you have it this video was a little different so let me know if you liked it and if you want to see a followup with YouTuber products",in front of me right now are VTech products made by the world's biggest celebrities everything from smart watches that replace your smartphone to microphones that make you sing better to Cyclone powerered popcorn machines so have these celebrities used their special talents to make something genuinely amazing or have

@Mrwhosetheboss,Diamond,vSIbvJB4WdI,iPhone 16 Pro Max vs Samsung S24 Ultra Camera Battle!,this is the iPhone 16 Pro Max this is the Samsung Galaxy s24 Ultra when we compared the Samsung to last year's iPhone Samsung 1 with 6.5 points to 4.5 and so the question is can this new iPhone with its capture button faster and higher quality shooting improved Ultra wide camera and close-ups better microphones and a lot more software features reemerge as the king of smartphone photography or has Samsung with all of the updates since launch actually pulled even further ahead of the iPhone oh yeah and the phone that wins this test is the phone permanently switched to oh my God that's going to be me so let's start with sound quality you're listening to the Samsungs right now and it sounds good iPhones and Samsungs have been pretty neck and neck when it comes to this for years now but this year that changes cuz now you're listening to the iPhones Apple has upgraded to four microphones instead of Samsung 3 they're apparently higher grade studio microphones whatever that means but also Apple has paid particular attention to wind noise reduction and you can tell I mean this is is the best sounding audio that I have ever heard on any phone with the additional option now of selecting whose audio the phone focuses on since the thing now records 360° Sound by default so last time sound was a draw this time I feel very confident handing the win to the iPhone 16 Pro Max and while we're at it how's the video quality well the iPhone 15 Pro Max was already ahead of Samsung when it comes to video so now that that's been updated to the 16 Pro Max it pretty much smokes the Samsung on all fronts so so that's in terms of the ultra wide camera can you see how the iPhone is both wider so it gets more in the shot while also having the same amount of detail when you get up close even though you have to punch in more to get to it it's in terms of dynamic range the ability of your phone to evenly expose your shot so you don't have something that's too bright or too dark but look at the trees in the background here can you see that Samsung has kind of lost the information in them now let's be very clear the iPhone isn't always better we did find in a few scenes that the iPhone was trying to make things too balanced but to do that it had to make the dark areas unnaturally bright but it's better on average apple is also better when it comes to noise if you look at the brick work over here you can see that you don't even need to go to a night scene for Samsung to start looking a little grainy and soft and I actually could not believe the difference between the two phones here I think it's massive but the biggest thing for me is just detail like if you wanted to get in closer to see me having the time of my life on perhaps the most thrilling ride in existence it's not going to look very good on the Samsung both phones do also have an action mode for when things get really out of hand and they both make big strides in terms of smoothing out all of the absolutely insane acrobatics I was being subjected to on this roller coaster but the iPhones is slightly higher resolution and a little bit cleaner the only exception that I could find to this rule is 8k the Galaxy s24 Ultra shoots 8K video and when you get the right conditions it's actually really good and it definitely trumps the iPhone it's just you have to get it right you have to work around Samsung's other video shortcomings to properly take advantage of it to the point where I think most people will prefer how the iPhone's 4K footage looks to Samsung's 8K but things are changing when it comes to special modes and this is basically extras that your phone does that are fun but they're not part of the core camera experience so that's slow motion that's close-up macro mode that's any kind of cinematic video mode and last time I did this test I gave the point to Samsung because of its ability to shoot slow motion in 4k which was significantly better than Apple's 1080p but now the iPhone do 4K too and actually Apple's slow-mo is like when you're taking normal videos just less noisy than Samsung's it actually feels 100% on par with the quality that you get on your normal iPhone video mode and the iPhone has also had an upgrade to macro since the ultra wide camera on the phone has gone from 12 mapel to now 48 and macro uses this Ultra wide camera so now the iPhone does take noticeably more detailed close-ups in Samsung apologies for the slightly strange example but um you'd be surprised how Unpretty things look when you 2 cm away from them and then your portrait cinematic video is well I find pretty comparable between the two but the improvements to the iPhone and the other things are enough for this special modes category to swing completely from a Samsung win to an iPhone win one thing that only the iPhone does is space your video to watch back on your Apple Vision Pro but I feel like it's a little early in the day for mixed reality headsets for that to be any kind of substantial perk besides I feel like if you have a Vision Pro you're definitely an iPhone user anyway what about selfies well there's a couple of things to bear in mind first of all that both phones can either shoot narrow selfies for just you or wider to capture a full scene and when you choose to go wide on the iPhone it is wider I wouldn't say there's a tangible difference in detail between the two but I do find it so interesting how both of these phones have such a different style and interpretation of exactly the same scene and yet they both also kind of seem right when you take them so really this one's up to you but I do personally prefer the Samsung I just think there's something about the warmth of the skin tones the vibrancy of the scenery oh and also Samsung does a cracking job at portraits so portrait selfies look better the iPhone does now have some new photographic styles that let you tweak the skin tone in your shots to exactly your preference and I will say the way that Apple sold this the idea of you deciding how you want to look in your photos and then setting that style as your default and then always looking right from that point onwards is actually very enticing but it's just that in practice your skin tone is going going to look different in every photo anyway because of all the other factors and so if you really wanted to get this skin tone thing right you'd probably have to go through like every single photo ever taken of you and tweak each one individually which doesn't feel like a sensible use of time now the video from these front cameras is every bit as important anytime you want to record a little holiday Vlog anytime you want to make a Tik Tok anytime you video call someone these are the cameras that you're banking on and while I'm happy that what the while I'm happy that Samsung is paying attention to the hardware in their front camera they are definitely being let down with the software processing so have a look at this clip do you not think that Samsung looks more cinematic like I'm being filmed with a proper rear camera as opposed to a tiny little selfie camera it feels more professional compared to the iPhone's more basic setup but there are caveats the iPhone camera makes me look better for starters pretty consistently Samsung's got a real gritty vibe to it you know kind of like I'm filming the next Batman movie the iPhone front camera is less grainy too you notice Samsung really struggling when you're not in ideal lighting and it's it's such a shame because you know that they've actually put a better camera on the front of their phone but the biggest difference have a look at this I created a burner Instagram account with zero followers to see how well each camera takes footage directly within other apps and as you can see here Apple has done a really good job optimizing the Instagram camera to retain most of the video and audio processing that happens in its normal camera app but even when you're going straight onto Instagram Samsung not so much and I feel like at this point it's less of a Samsung issue it's more of an Android issue there's just there's too many devices on Android for Instagram to optimize for every single one both phones also shoot cinematic video on their front camera which is good I think it adds a lot of much needed depth to what could otherwise be quite a flat camera I think Apple shoots in higher quality but Samsung just gets portrait mode I really like the style of it but overall we have to give selfie video to the iPhone but one part of the camera experience that I feel like gets very overlooked is the camera app itself a good camera app is going to give you a ton of options it's going to make shooting fun and most importantly it's going to allow you to take what you want to take quickly and on that note the difference in shooting speed is now back to being large again Apple used to be far ahead and Samsung closed the Gap and now apple is far ahead again particularly when you're shooting using both phones high resolution modes so this is Apple's 48 megap versus Samsung's 50 megapix mode and it's not just that it feels fast it has a tangible impact on your photos like look here it's not just that the iPhone managed to stop the water earlier in its tracks but it has actually stopped the water you can see the texture inside of this stream which I think is absolutely insane and while you're probably not taking a lot of photos of frog fountains the same differences will also apply to photos of family where someone's constantly laughing or friends that don't listen to instructions and kids that don't sit still I would also say that the iPhone's app is a little prettier and a little more intuitive to use with one hand like pretty much everything you might need to use is always a swipe away as well as still being a little smoother and faster than Samsung's but then Samsung's got some stuff going for it too you get more settings more control over exactly what you want your camera experience to be but the big thing is really you'll probably have noticed this throughout the entire video that Samsung's display is super bright and the reduced glare that it screen picks up actually makes the photo taking experience tangibly better so I'm going to go for a draw on this one and yes you can control the entire Samsung camera app using just the S Pen and some air gestures which is wildly cool by the way but you just I mean you'll probably use it like once in your life and then yes there is also the new camera control on the iPhone which same if you want to hear my rant on this button or not button whatever you call it that's in my unboxing video but for the purposes of now I'm going to say that it adds nothing of note to the iPhone's camera experience and on the subject of the camera experience let's talk editing you might have seen that Samsung has full generative edit capability ities so you can pick up objects you can move those objects you can resize them and the phone will fill in the blanks automatically Samsung has sketch to image you make a little Doodle and then the phone turns that doodle into a real object in your image which is often fiddly and a little disappointing but every now and again jaw-droppingly impressive an Apple has basically nothing this is where you feel the consequence of Apple being late to the AI party as of right now the only AI editing feature currently announced is cleanup which is not bad but it's coming later in a software up date and based on the beta it doesn't feel as sophisticated yet as what other phones are doing and this is where I would say Samsung picks up a bit of steam cuz I would say they also win when it comes to zoom too I remember when the s24 ultra first came out not being particularly impressed by Zoom but it seems like updates since that launch have brought it back up to scratch both phones have a five times optical zoom lens but Samsung's five times is higher resolution and it also feels like Samsung knows what to do with it better it feel feels like they're not afraid to really dial up the software processing on images when you zoom in a lot which not everyone's going to love but I think it's what these images need we even tried a concert environment and can you see how when you get super up close that there's not actually much more information being captured on the Samsung it's just correcting the image way more aggressively and confidently and it makes it better not to mention that Samsung also has a second zoom camera at three times which just helps to keep Zoom shots high quality throughout the entire Zoom range and also as I've alluded to earlier in this video Samsung just gets portrait mode Apple was the first company to do any kind of portrait mode well but you can just tell that in the meantime Samsung has really invested energy into making sure that their portrait mode becomes something special it's got that magic combination of realistic background blur that doesn't feel like too much and gently gets more blurred as objects get further away with extremely good reliable Edge detection and colors that the key caveat is that these portraits were taken on the five time zoom cameras which favors Samsung because they've got a better one when you take portraits using the one times main camera then Apple does gain a big leg up cuz it can shoot 24 megap portraits instead of Samsung's 12 but I do think that portraits in general do look better when you're more zoomed in so this one's for Samsung now just before we get to the crowning of what is going to be my new phone we need to talk about core photo quality and Nightmare mode so the main change to photo quality with the iPhone 16 Pro is the new 48 map Ultra wide camera and it was definitely the thing to change since this is the one area that I felt it was weaker than the Samsung in but on first glance there's not really a massive difference between the two unless unless you specifically use Apple's high res 48 megapixel modes but if you do use that then yeah Samsung just can't keep up because its Ultra wide is only 12 at maximum Now using the high-res photo mode with which Apple calls Heath Max is not without compromise it means that photos take a bit longer to capture it means you don't get live photos anymore and high resolution photos also take up more space but here's what I think Apple's done really well I think the photos still capture fast enough and Apple's heat file format is actually so efficient that a 48 megapixel shot on this takes up like half the storage of a 12 megapixel shot on this so they've made it convenient enough that I will actually just keep Heath Max on by default and so the iPhone does become the much better Ultra wide camera for me and that's mostly true for the main camera too technically Samsung destroys Apple in terms of resolution Samsung's main cam is 200 megap Apple's is 48 but then when you really boil it down the best photo quality that Samsung can take without some sort of major compromise in terms of processing quality or capture time is 12 whereas Apple's default is 24 you can take every normal photo on the iPhone in 24 megapixel without needing to change any settings or think about it or sacrifice anything and that I think is a massive perk and yes you can if you want to take a 200 megapixel photo on the Samsung but it's kind of like the whole 8K video thing there are situations in which it will be amazing but only in absolutely ideal conditions more often than not I found that the iPhone's lower resolution shot will still look better so I'm giving the category of photos to the iPhone it's not a blanket win there are absolutely times when I think Samsung has made someone's face look better or has a nicer pop of color but if we're going on averages then 70 to 80% of the shots the iPhone takes I think are better now based on what you've seen so far you've probably guessed what happens when things get super dark like yeah Samsung's video becomes noisy that same thing that you noticed a little bit during the day gets exacerbated when the lighting becomes challenging like look how much grain there is in the smoke coming out of this fire Samsung also gets a little funky when it comes to color control like all of a sudden why does my sky look so deep blue that it's it's like I'm sitting in front of a blue screen or like when we tried walking to an area with lots of bright lights that weren't white lights Samsung makes those colors so intense that you are actually losing detail on what those lights are shining onto but the night photos are quite comparable this one was actually kind of shocking for me because this scene was so dark I could barely see where I was going and both phones rescued it the only key consistent difference that I noticed between these two phones is when things get dark Apple lets your images get a bit grainy Samsung will smooth your image to get rid of grain and then add sharpening back into the photo to correct for that smoothness actually this Zoom shot is like the perfect example of my point can you see how as we zoom into this tent to capture I'm left with two very different looking images in which neither feels wrong or better than the other it feels like the amount of detail being captured is pretty equivalent but the difference in video is enough to swing this night category into Apple's C so that means we have a complete score flip in the last test it was 6.5 to Samsung and 4.5 to the iPhone this time it's 6.5 iPhone 4.5 Samsung the new iPhone isn't the most exciting iPhone upgrade but the camera improvements they've made are important ones so this is now the phone that I'm going to switch to and you want to know why I've been completely comfortable propping my phone up in all sorts of weird places to take the shots for this video it's because of this the tauras oand 360° spin Cas our sponsor so this case is not just a case it's a case mag safe it's a kickstand and it's a grip it's all of these things in one and it actually does them all better than these separate individual gadgets with the case having raised edges to protect every part of the phone the grip being permanently locked into the phone and the stand working perfectly for both vertical and horizontal use but then they have the glasso X screen protector which applies perfectly almost every single time thanks to a mechanism that pulls out air from the center shortening the distance that air needs to escape escape from and it also perfectly highlights the new thinner screen borders on the iPhone while being compatible with most cases and resistant to both scratches and 12T drops oh yeah and I've managed to get I say full 20% off everything in the Tes store so link below to check it out,this is the iPhone 16 Pro Max this is the Samsung Galaxy s24 Ultra when we compared the Samsung to last year's iPhone Samsung 1 with 6.5 points to 4.5 and so the question is can this new iPhone with its capture button faster and higher quality shooting improved Ultra wide camera and close-ups better microphones and a lot more software features reemerge as the king of smartphone photography or has Samsung with all of,-0.4389,0.9999,0.7184
@Mrwhosetheboss,Diamond,cRPBp2tRxFY,iPhone 16 / 16 Pro Unboxing - Testing every new feature!,"this is the iPhone 16 the iPhone 16 plus the 16 Pro and the 16 Pro Max so every new iPhone as well as bucket load of new accessories and this is where we find out if these things are actually good or not so let's unbox the iPhone 16 and 16 plus first and notice Apple did say this is now an even smaller package compared to last year's phones I have to be honest I can barely tell the difference it's about 6% smaller in reality but it does look like they have rearranged the entire inside to accommodate this shrink so now you get the phone there's a USBC cable combined with a Sim ejector and it looks like no Apple stickers this time around and here's our iPhone 16 these are also apparently the first iPhones to have 100% wood fiber based packaging which is good although last year's phones had 99% so let's not get too excited and this is iPhone 16 plus and I'm actually kind of happy about these colors this is the closest we've been in a long time to well just actually proper blue and pink very expensive gender reveal anyone so having actually used the phones I would genuinely say the audio mixing feature is unexpectedly crazy cool so you guys start having a conversation now and while they're talking behind the phone I'm talking to you guys standing in front of the phone so this is kind of like the equivalent of me being on a movie set and I'm the cameraman and they're the actors that I'm filming hey let's see what that clip looked like so open it up head into the edit and then click audio mix so there's four options here we'll start with a default way that the iPhone sounds and while they're talking behind the phone I'm talking FR bit of a mess right but then you click in frame flow so you want flow it's like really fine and eggs you want really rich my audio basically disappears it's it's like a magic trick there is more to this feature but I'll get to it when we talk about the pro phones okay so what about gaming because the iPhone 16s have jumped forward two generations in terms of their chip this time around this should be one of the biggest changes and now also means that these phones have access to that same library of console games that only the pros could play last year so why don't we see how they run man the idea of playing like proper console Assassin's Creed on my phone is basically a childhood dream okay really impressive draw distances meaning that like it's kind of crazy that I can see stuff happening on the other side of this massive City the game is running smooth it's a very consistent 30 frames per second I would say you can tell that a lot of settings have had to be very far dialed back from the console versions to the point where it does kind of still look like a mobile game but then the upside is that it doesn't feel like a mobile game in terms of the scope of it it's massive I'm impressed I'm not blown away but I'm impressed now two of the most obvious changes on the iPhone 16 are both camera related one is the new layout of the cameras which unlocks this new option in the camera app called spatial video and I have played around with it it's lower quality than normal video it only shoots in 1080p but if you do somehow happen to have a Vision Pro lying around it is surprisingly transportative it really does take you there but then again you know this was the first time I used my Vision Pro since my review 6 months ago this isn't a useful enough gadget for this feature that only works on this gadget to mean anything but that might change in the future the second thing is this new camera control that you get on the side this is the thing that's in all the Tik toks this is what people are talking about so a heavy press on it takes a photo a light press activates the Zoom slider so you have full control over Zoom by swiping along it and then a double Light press opens up a menu which if you don't want the swipe gesture to control Zoom allows you to select something else that it can control and when I first went hands on with it my very first hot take was why like who asked for this so now that I've had some proper time to get to know it how my opinion changed well it has allowed me to appreciate the attention to detail that's gone into it I like the fact that it's flush with the body of the phone so it's not yet another protrusion that makes a thing uncomfortable to hold I like that you have a surprising amount of control over how the control works with settings like How firm you need to press to activate the thing I like the little bit of haptic feedback you get every time you hit a key magnification number as you're zooming in it is quite cool that the official Apple cases cover and protect the camera control while keeping the swiping gestures completely usable but no my opinion has not changed I think this is dumb you have to lower your grip to reach it you have to arch your thumb in a way that genuinely causes me hand strain you got to hold your phone tighter than usual cuz you're now supporting it less and after all that you're more likely to get last minute camera Shake because you're heavy pressing a button as opposed to lightly tapping your screen and if that wasn't enough it also feels like in trying to make this camera control work for both the portrait orientations and the landscape orientations they've just made it not good with either because for portrait it needs to be higher up so you're not going like this and for landscape it needs to be lower like here so you can actually reach it without using some weird unconventional hand claw separately though I will say I appreciate how you can now pause a video recording so you can have multiple separate Clips in one video as opposed to having multiple videos and also how you don't need to stop whatever music is playing on your phone when you start recording these are both overdue but good improvements for creators in iOS 18 but what about the photo quality because while the main camera hasn't changed on this 16 you know that new a18 chip that the phone has does contain a brand new image signal processor which every year is becoming a bigger factor for your photos so I thought this would be a fun thing to do this is the iPhone 16 this is last year's iPhone 15 and then this is an iPhone 12 which I imagine is closer to what most of you might be upgrading from okay I'm a jump in the shot and finger guns why did I say that right yeah there's basically zero difference between the 15 and the 16 you can definitely see substantial upgrades from the 12 in terms of detail texture color that's not really something to brag about that's expected and between the 15 and 16 I can't see anything the 16 though can get way closer to things to take macro photos now that the ultrawide camera has autofocus and there is some improvement to the colors and the overall smoothness when it comes to night photos I guess because there's more processing in low light shots you notice the difference in the processor more oh yeah and the other thing because the chip is faster this time around these new iPhones can do way better quality quick take video you know when you're in photo mode but you just need to capture something right now you can hold down on the camera button and iPhones used to take a squarish looking lower resolution video that's what most phones do because when you're in photo mode your phone is ready and geared to taking photos not video but the new phones can just go straight into full resolution 4K recording but let's be very clear if what you're after is big camera improvements this ain't it that's coming on the 16 Pros which I'm getting to the only other camera feature that Apple did spend a fair bit of time talking about is photographic Styles and how this year they're splitting these Styles into mood which are more the Striking filter-like settings and then undertones which are more about how you want to look in your photos traditionally iPhones have always tended to make skin tones a little warmer than they are in reality but the idea of these undertones is to give that control back to you to decide that said I've tested all of them and all it did was make me come to the conclusion that I prefer the standard one that iPhones have been using by default since the beginning okay only other thing that I wanted to mention before we go to the pro iPhones is at the launch event Apple said that the glass on the front of these phones is 50% stronger than last gen and that meant basically ially nothing to anyone because they didn't explain it but I think I've managed to find out how now so the problem with glass on its own is that the atoms within glass have a pretty weak structure their Arrangement is disordered which means that if you apply pressure to Glass the atoms can't smoothly Glide over each other so the material doesn't Flex it shatters and so a few years ago Apple realized that by infusing that glass with tiny clear pieces of ceramic which has a much more organized 3D Matrix of atoms they could create more structure within the display and therefore more ability to withstand pressure and so the new thing this time round is they've improved the organization of ceramic within the glass which increases the compressive stress capacity of the display or in other words this might not be significantly less likely to crack but if it does crack that crack is a lot less likely to spread out across the entire screen so there you go I had to make sure I got to the bottom of that one and that's basically it for all the new stuff that the iPhone 16s do except for the action button which the pro phones had last year a better battery and apple intelligence but I'm getting to that okay time for the top end phones iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max they used to do this cool thing where the base phones had white packaging and the pros came with black but I guess that's officially buried now maybe the colored dies were adding to the pollution so this is the 16 Pro which we have in the same natural titanium color as last year's phones came in and then for the pro Max this is Desert titanium which is the only new color this year I feel like apple is really spacing out the Innovation here and honestly to me this feels disappointingly stale for the one Flagship new color but then while we're here this is what the new cases look like so it seems like fine woven cases are officially dead that's probably for the best but it's quite funny how much of a disaster that was so we're back to Silicon now and this is I mean it's good quality but it is expensive for a case there's the new clear case which I would personally never go for cuz they just get sticky and fingerprint and these are the new airpods 4 with noise cancellation which come with a set of papers for some reason and then it's just the earphones in their case and I have tested these by the way so quick Mini review good product they don't feel too big in your ears so you completely forget they're there they're super light but then at the same time they give like zero indication that they could fall out when you shake your head around the noise cancellation is the best I have ever heard for earphones with no ear tips and there's practically zero leakage either even for people sitting right next to you the sound quality isn't as good as the a pros and I'd say that even though the noise cancellation does make them sound quite a bit better than the previous standard airpods you wouldn't have to look hard to find better sounding earphones for $180 but they sound a lot better than the previous gen standard airpods mostly thanks to the noise isolation so I'm still going to stick to the pros but I'm glad to see that there is now a decent Apple made option for people who don't like the feeling of pressure that you can get from ear tips okay and then finally for this unboxing this is the upgraded mag safe charger it is cool how every single product down to the accessories has the same peeling experience and that it always seems to work and then the kind of chunky 30 WT power brick that lets you get the best speed out of that Max zave charger more on these in a bit so first thing I want to look at with these phones is audio you know how we looked at the audio mixing feature on the bass iPhones well while the feature does completely work both on the non-pro and the pros it's even better on the pros thanks to four supposedly Studio grade microphones and so I thought these phones would be a really cool way to show you this other type of audio mix called Studio that makes the microphones sound like they're really close to your mouth check this out so this is me talking to you using normal phone audio and it sounds phone likee you hear a little bit of everything this is what it sounds like when we switch over to studio and as someone who spends a lot of time messing around with microphones trying to get the best out of every scene I find this absolutely mind-blowing it is crazy that this is recorded on a phone and nothing else that said you can have the coolest most unique Innovative feature in the world but will I actually use this audio mix stuff probably not that often it's nice to have the reassurance that at any time I want I can cuz every iPhone 16 is recording spatial 360 audio by default anyway so it's not like you're having to do or think about anything extra but yeah I am struggling to see the average user trolling through their entire library of videos tweaking whose audio they want to prioritize in each clip but different story entirely if you're buying the iPhone as your main film making tool for most of our videos I still prefer the way that Sony camera looks and the way that a road microphone sounds but if you looking at the iPhone 16 Pro to be your primary content creation device then the audio on them just got very quickly very good but camera quality should actually be the biggest upgrade this year so this is an iPhone 15 Pro Max this is an iPhone 16 Pro Max and that is a particularly challenging lighting environment we are shooting against the sun all right hit me and that looks basically the same although 16 Pro Max is actually slightly better at keeping the blue sky looking blue even through the trees but the main benefit of the new phone over the old phone is not actually meant to be picture quality it's meant to be the fact that the new phone has a faster sensor that can capture more information quickly so can you take photos faster little known feature of the iPhones by the way if you tap and hold the shutter button and drag it to the left hand side you rapid fire and nope they have shot the exact same number of photos I will say though if you just Mash that shutter button then the new iPhone is definitely taking more shots and it's freezing up less but no one does that what actually would be useful to see though is if you just wanted to take one high resolution 48 megapixel photo can the new phone take it faster so I'm going to stand in front of these phones I'm going to throw this ball in the air and we're going to capture at exactly the same time so in theory whichever phone's photo has the ball lower in the air has captured the photo faster 3 2 one oh my God you took these at the same time yeah it's actually so quick you don't even see the shutter that's actually a much bigger difference than I was expecting it looks like I've used AI to remove the ball on the first photo but it's actually just disappeared out of the frame man I swear this is like the coolest thing I own but the main tangible benefit to this faster sensor according to Apple at least is meant to be video where the iPhone 15 Pros can shoot a Max of 4K video at 60 frames per second the new phone can do 4K 120 but let's actually investigate that so this is a water balloon I'm actually pretty scared this is going to be explosive oh God also separate note even though the screen on the new phone is meant to be just as bright as that of the old phone we can't get it to the same level of brightness it seems to be consistently slightly dimmer but hey at least as far as the video quality is concerned it looks like there is basically zero compromise even though we've doubled the frame rate from last year I have seen 4K 120 on other phones before but it has never looked this good and the nice thing about this frame rate is you can slow that footage down four times and still get a smooth result the previous 60 frame per second footage kind of falls apart here right so what about how much storage space it takes up so the clip is 1 minute 25 on both phones and the storage size is not quite double but very nearly double so 1 minute 25 is nearly a gab that means that the entire storage of the iPhone 16 Pro base model so 128 gigs will be taken up with less than 3 hours of footage on the camera that is not good also another thing that I thought was interesting was let's say I take a video at 12 frames per second I slow that down to 25% speed on my phone but then I want to share that video with someone else you get options you can either share that video with no metadata which means that the other person will just get the video as you intended it to be or you send with everything which means that they get all of this info associated with that file and they can reverse engineer it themselves and same thing for photographic Styles you can take a photo in one style you can decide later if you want to shift over to a different style and then if you share it the other person can also completely reverse any tone changes you've made or tweak it in a different direction all without any loss to image quality because the details of the original image are baked into the data of the shot even when it's edited however it's actually the ultrawide cameras that I'm most curious about the new phone has a 48 megapixel ultrawide camera which will still actually shoot 12 megap photos like the last phone by default so what you need to do is to tap Heath Max here and once you've done that once you never need to do it again it means that from now on your phone will always shoot the highest resolution photo that it possibly can depending on what Zoom magnification you're using although it's not for free because everything is going to take up more storage space and also even though the main camera as we've seen has this faster sensor that can capture these high resolution photos quicker the ultrawide does not so that takes longer to capture on this mode that said if the quality is much better then worthwhile tradeoff let's see oh yes actually substantial detail upgrade and actually if you look at the fabric on my hoodie you can see quite a bit less noise as well not to mentioned it's managed to brighten my dark joggers a little bit so the high dynamic range is better it's actually just all around a vastly upgraded photo and also a more detailed ultrawide camera should also mean more detailed macro photos ah okay this is working a little different to how I expected so I was expecting that because this is a 48 megap Ultra wide camera you would actually be able to take 48 map macro photos but when you're on the automatic macro mode of the phone and you take a shot it's still actually only taking a 12 megap photo because the phone is actually cropping into that 4 8 mapel sensor to get as close as possible that said because you're cropping in using a higher resolution base the new phone's macros are still noticeably more detailed than the old phones I also took a bunch of night photos to see if I could spot any Trends and there is definitely an improvement but it's definitely not a massive Improvement right before we get to the real elephant in the room with this whole Apple intelligence shenanigan let's talk charging and by the way if you want to have basically unlimited power on the go then this mag safe power bank from ESI our sponsor is kind of wild it's got a 5,000 Mah capacity it can charge your phone with a wire but it also supports the new ch2 wireless charging standard and that means it will charge your phone about 30 minutes faster than other power Banks like it while being 38% Slimmer and having a kickstand built into the thing they also have this separate range of cryoboost chargers which solve the biggest problem with wireless charging it generates a ton of heat and so every cryoboost charger has a cooling Fern oh I can actually feel the air coming out a heat dissipation chamber as well as AI Wizardry to keep temperatures down and therefore wireless charging fast and your phone healthy in the long term and this one charger can handle your watch your airpods and your phone at the same time but yeah I use ESR stuff on the daily because of how much you get for the money so link below for the full lineup so these new iPhones are kind of weird when it comes to charging like I said the nextg industry standard for wireless charging is ch2 which allows phones to charge with 15 wats of power these phones can actually charge with up to 25 watts if you splurged on almost $100 combo of Apple's 25 W mag safe charger and 30 W brick you need a higher power brick because some power is lost when you're wireless charging but then at the same time Apple's wired charging speed is so slow compared to the competition that they are maybe the only company whose wireless charging is apparently the same speed as their wired charging feels like yet another indicator that apple is really eyeing up the idea of a completely portless iPhone one day okay so the final question that we need to answer is Apple intelligence is it good does it save the iPhone 16s from becoming what would otherwise be a very minor update well here's where I have a couple of Bones to pick firstly if you buy an iPhone 16 now you will not get apple intelligence straight out the box it's coming in a software update later although I've set up a beta so that I can show you now and secondly it's not exclusive to these FMS which isn't in itself a problem it's good when more people can experience these features but it just makes the launch event feel a little misleading cuz Apple spent half of the iPhone 16 section talking about Apple intelligence but then the fact that almost everything also works on the iPhone 15 Pro means that those features have very little to do with iPhone 16 Hardware anyways here's my rapid fire thoughts having spent some time with apple intelligence now the summaries that it gives you to your emails are actually a really useful way to quickly catch up with a full context of a conversation cleanup is a really quick Snappy way to remove distractions from photos but I would actually say its results seem less good than they do on my Google pixel I really like the way that smart replies is integrated but it only works for answering specific types of questions and doesn't exactly do it with much Pizzazz it's a little flat with how it responds one of the key categories of features is writing tools they're available systemwide so whatever app you're in if you highlight a bunch of text and tap writing tools you get these options and I don't really use any of these rewriting tools cuz I just for me tone is so important and something in my tone always seems to get lost whenever I try it the key points and summary features though are really cool at distilling big chunks of text down to smaller bites I just I don't use them myself because I don't quite trust them like if I'm saying something on a video to potentially millions of people I need to double triple check that that information is Right whereas getting my information through an ai's interpretation of a source as opposed to the source itself is like a fast track to something getting lost in communication and that's basically all I can really test properly with the current beta I've got high hopes for Siri once it gets chat GPT integration but right now it's not doing much more than the Siri you're used to so as for what I think to all of these new iPhones even though it feels like we're on the precipice of transformative Chang to the software most of those things aren't here yet and what was meant to be one of the biggest Hardware changes this camera control is I think a bit of a stretch in both senses of the word that said while they're not the most exciting phones to upgrade to if you're on like an iPhone 12 and you've been holding out for the next thing they are safe phones to upgrade to they're fast the Basse iPhone 16s have good screens and the pros have great screens this time although the Basse iPhones do still have that 60 HZ refresh rate which if you're used to having better will make them feel laggy but also battery improvements are always very appreciated over here and the battery has been great on all of these new phones but more on that in my battery test which is hopefully going live in a couple of days so see you there",this is the iPhone 16 the iPhone 16 plus the 16 Pro and the 16 Pro Max so every new iPhone as well as bucket load of new accessories and this is where we find out if these things are actually good or not so let's unbox the iPhone 16 and 16 plus first and notice Apple did say this is now an even smaller package compared to last year's phones I have

@mkbhd,Diamond,z19HM7ANZlo,The M4 Mac Mini is Incredible!,"(box clunks) (tape tearing) (chilled lo-fi music) (wrap rustling) (upbeat electronic music) - So usually, one crazy thing
about a new piece of tech is enough to get my attention, just something out of
the ordinary about it. But this new Mac mini has three things about it that are insane. So instead of having an event this year, Apple decided to do a bunch
of press releases in a row for the last week of October to update their whole Mac lineup to M4. And one of them was for this new Mac mini. Now, a lot of us might not give too much thought to the Mac mini, like, yeah, maybe it
holds an important place as the most affordable Mac, but if you're not buying one, you're not really thinking
about it too much. But the number one most insane
thing about this refresh is, well, I mean look at it, it's tiny. It is absolutely tiny. Apple's gone through and redesigned basically all of their computers now that have gotten the Mac silicon update. Well, except this one, this is the same design as a while ago, but the Mac mini was kind of technically overdue for a redesign. And the new one, it actually
kinda looks a little bit more like a shrunken Mac Studio
than a shrunken old Mac mini. But it's now a five inch
by five inch footprint and two inches tall. I'll say that again, a five by
five by two desktop computer. Now I like small desktops, and yes, you could get a
tiny desktop computer before, there's plenty of amazing
mini ITX build videos all over the internet that
I've watched for years. They're sick. But there's levels to this, there's small computers and
then there's tiny computers. And this Mac mini is smaller
than my R5 with a lens on it. It's smaller than a new roll of duct tape. It's smaller than the
footprint of the new iPhone and barely bigger than the
absolutely tiny Apple TV. Apple's seemingly had this obsession with making certain computers
as small as possible, even before Apple silicon came along. So this has just kind of
unlocked another level for them to push it even further than ever before. Yeah, there are fans in here, but there are also ports on the back. Gigabit ethernet by default,
full size HDMI is still here. And then three Thunderbolt
ports on the back and then there's two
USB-C 3 ports on the front plus the headphone jack. So still no SD card reader. And there's obviously now no more USB-A. If you tried to build or buy another computer
to match this thing, you will either end up building a computer that's just as small but
nowhere near as capable, or a computer that's just as capable, but nowhere near as small. It is just a hilariously
unnecessarily tiny computer. It's great. I would also like to start
a new conspiracy theory. I would like to use this video
to start a conspiracy theory. I think that there is someone
whose job it is at Apple, someone whose sole purpose
(sinister mysterious music) is to come up with one obnoxious
thing to complain about for every new Apple product redesign. Like this is the person that
put the notch on the iPhone. This is the person that
put the charge port at the bottom of the Magic Mouse. And this person's best work is right here on this new Mac mini, putting the power button
on the bottom of it. Like, why? There are so many better
places to put a power button, like at the front or the side, or literally anywhere on the back, like all the other small Mac desktops. Or at the top. That
would've been fine too. But no, they chose behind the back corner, which is (sighs) just... I mean, I don't use
that button very often. I don't really turn the Mac on and off with a button almost ever. I might sleep it and wake it back up, and maybe every couple of weeks, I'll have to remember that
the button's back there. But yeah, it's just dumb
enough to get memed on and complained about without
actually being an issue. Well played, guy. But yeah, you know, the
typical consequences of a computer getting smaller are battery, speakers, and thermals. There's just less room
inside for those things. Battery of course doesn't make a huge difference on a desktop, who cares? Speakers, kind of the
same thing, who cares? And thermals have been redesigned in a way that seem to be working just fine. This thing hardly gets over a peep. If you do heavy stuff,
the single fan spins up and you can hear it, but
it's always been quiet, sitting on the desk,
you can hardly hear it. So then the number two insane
thing about the new Mac mini is that the base model is kind
of an incredible deal now. No, like I don't think you understand it. I think it's actually one
of the best deals in tech. It's certainly the best out of any of Apple's new product
offerings right now. And I mean, I'm kind of
not used to saying it, but it is a really good deal. So this base M4 Mac mini costs 599, right? So for that, you get the base
computer with the M4 chip, which has quietly doubled
to 16 gigs of unified memory instead of eight from before. So the 10 core CPU and the 10 core GPU. Now we're four generations
into Apple silicon and the gains are
actually kind of starting to stack up versus M1. We already know it was a huge difference from the Intel chips, but I
actually wanna get a little bit more into that in the MacBook Pro review because I've been using
an M1 Max MacBook Pro for three years since it came out. And the M4 Max is the first one that's actually tempted me to upgrade between generations of Apple silicon. It's really interesting. So get subscribed and
stay tuned for that video when it comes out. But the main thing you need to know is this base M4 chip is great, it's super solid and power efficient at everyday normal
activities like web browsing and music streaming and
multitasking like crazy. And it can handle what
I think I would call medium-grade activities very easily. Not heavy stuff like
graphically-intensive gaming or a heavy video editing, but pretty much anything short of that. This could be a coding
and developing machine, this could be a photo editing machine. Pixelmator runs like a dream. And fun fact, Apple just bought
Pixelmator, interestingly. But yeah, just having
a ton of Arc tabs open, stuff like that, like just
running around, multitasking, it runs like a dream, it's great. It's as good as you'd expect the world's fastest single
core performer to do. So yeah, Mac mini, you know,
four years, like I said, it has been the most affordable Mac, the sort of entry point for
anyone to get into Mac OS. But this year with the
doubling of the base memory, it just feels like a
particularly good deal. Think of it this way, the M4 iMac that also just got refreshed is basically the exact same computer, but just in an upright desktop with a non replaceable display. That starts at $1,299. So you can use that $700 difference to kind of get whatever screen you want. Now, you can obviously also
upgrade from the base Mac mini, but I don't think you
should, and I'll explain why. See, Apple is known for building what I've called a price ladder, and they're just trying to get you to climb as high as possible. They do this across all their products, but there's basically always
a really tempting upgrade sitting right above the base model. And then when you spend that money, you're kind of right underneath
another tempting upgrade, and then they kind of walk you up, trying to get you to spend
as much money as possible. It's really smart, they do it with iPhones and with iPads and with everything else. This base Mac mini, I'm
telling you is a good deal, but it only has 256 gigs of storage. And many people are fine with that and they can live with that, that's great. But if you know you're gonna
be working with a lot of media, a lot of video, then you start looking at
upgrades to the storage, and that's where you'll
find that walking it up to a terabyte costs 400 more dollars. Or if you plan to do
some wired networking, bumping it up to 10 gig ethernet costs 100 more dollars on top of that. for the price of just those upgrades, you could almost get an
entire nother MAC mini. It's crazy. Like basically, across the board, Apple's upgrade pricing is
pretty crazy with this computer, which is why I'm specifically saying the base model is such a good deal. And actually if you're lucky enough to have a .edu email address right now, the student discount drops it
down to 499, which is sick. But once you know you're
gonna be doing upgrades to the pre-purchase spec, which you have to know before buying it, 'cause you can't upgrade
it after the fact, all the memory, everything is built in, then it becomes more of a normal deal. I do wanna say this though. So the third and final crazy
thing about this Mac Mini is that the maxed out version has a case for the best portable workstation Mac. Now this doesn't apply to everybody. This is coming from me, someone who used to drag an
iMac Pro in a Pelican case through the airport to events because it was the fastest editing machine that I could reasonably travel with, and it actually made sense for me. So coming from that perspective, this new Mac mini is sick. So looking at the Mac Studios, those aren't upgraded to M4 yet, they've all got the M2 generation. And it's also not gonna be the Mac Pro, which is also still on the M2 generation and obviously not portable. The iMac is on M4, but there's no Pro chips, so
it's just the base M4 chip. So this Mac mini is the easiest way to pack an M4 Pro chip with you and just throw it in a
travel bag super easily. An equivalent spec'd
MacBook Pro with M4 Pro starts at $2,000, which is actually another
decently good deal as far as performance. But if you don't need a laptop
or if you just wanna plug and play into monitors wherever you go, 1399 gets you the M4 Pro Mac mini. And that upgrade also gets
you the back Thunderbolt ports being Thunderbolt 5
instead of Thunderbolt 4. So it can support three 6K
displays instead of two. So I've had and been
testing the M4 Pro here with 48 gigs of memory, and fun fact, if you run through
some synthetic benchmarks, this runs up the highest CPU
score of any desktop Mac ever. That includes the Mac Pro and the Mac Studios and all of them. This is by far the most
powerful single core we've ever seen by a lot. And then Multi-Core just barely tops Geekbench's all time Mac list, though as we know, CPU doesn't
really bump up all that much when you go from base
to Pro to Max to Ultra, it's way more GPU stuff. And so when you look at GPU benchmarks, the most powerful Mac
mini here with the M4 Pro, it was putting up M1 Max numbers, which again, shows how much
these generations over time have been improving and
stacking on top of each other. I've been editing videos
on an M1 Max laptop for three years now on the MacBook Pro. So this Mac mini feels like one of those impossibly small computers Apple's like always
kind of wanted to make, even before Apple silicon. Like you probably remember
some of their earlier attempts, like the ""Trashcan"" MAC Pro, no doubt, they wanted do something crazy. They wanted to put a
workstation-class computer on the desk cooled by a single fan. We saw how that went with
the Intel chip inside, or even some of those
razor thin i9 MacBook Pros that started having overheating issues. But now that Apple silicon
has gotten this good and this efficient over time, they're actually able to
make tiny, powerful computers like the Mac Studio and now like this little
Mac mini over here. Nobody was asking for the
Mac mini to be even smaller, except for those people
in the Spaceship Campus somewhere in California. Well played. Well played. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys in the next one. Peace.

@mkbhd,Diamond,Yv_S7KrOlfk,The Tri Folding Phone Impressions!,"(shapes springing)
(bright electronic music) - All right, so you've
heard of flipping phones, you've heard of folding phones, but technology never slows down. So welcome to a phone with both. The world's first tri-fold phone. This thing, this is the Huawei
Mate XT, is what it's called. So I'd heard about this thing,
I'd seen some videos online, but it was also a Huawei
phone, so it was China-only. So knowing that I'm never
gonna daily-drive it, I didn't wanna, like, get too caught up. But it's so interesting. Like, I just had so many questions like, what is it like to use? What are the creases like? Like, what are the trade-offs? How hard is it to carry
a triple-folding phone? What are the case is like? Why is it called a tri-fold when it only technically folds twice? I need answers. So I was like, ""All right, I
need to get my hands on one."" I reached out to dbrand and asked, like, ""Can you guys get me a
contact where I can buy one?"" And I never asked questions, but they're always able to pull it off. And they did. So I spent the money,
I imported the thing, and now I can give you a tour
of the tri-fold experience. So let us start with just
when it's closed, right? When it's closed, you have a pretty reasonable
6.4-inch-sized phone. Well, I mean, you know,
reasonable from the front anyway. If you're just looking at it, using it, the screen gets plenty bright. It is 90 hertz. And then, somehow, the
bezels are pretty thin and even all the way around. The top and the bottom,
the left and the right. And actually, of course, the right side is the screen curving around the edge, so the software appropriately creates a fourth bezel to match. And it looks honestly
more like a normal phone than a lot of the other
foldables out there. So then, using it, you know,
you pretty quickly feel that it is thicker than a normal phone. But what's crazy is each
of these slices (chuckles) individually is ridiculously
thin, about four millimeters. So, in total, they add up to 13 millimeters thick when it's closed. Which would be pretty thick
if it was a slab phone, but that's actually about the same as a lot of the other single
folds, like the Z Fold 6. So then the power button/fingerprint
reader combo button and the volume buttons
on the right side here, they're pushed a little
bit back of the center. Not the end of the world. Totally usable. You're obviously gonna notice
that parts of the screen are a bit exposed and vulnerable if you're gonna put it in a pocket or in a backpack or something. But overall, just as a regular-sized single-screen smartphone experience, this is actually really respectable. This is like an eight out of 10, really close to the best
I've seen, which is awesome. But then you open it for the first time, and from here, you get
to the small tablet mode. So, yes, size-wise, now
we're basically matching a lot of the other
folding phones out there, like Pixel Fold, Samsung
Z Fold, et cetera. This is a 7.9-inch diagonal, that is roughly a square aspect ratio. I'll be honest, it looks fine, but I actually don't really
think it was meant to operate in this form factor most of the time. I mean, why stop halfway when you're just one more
fold away from greatness? But it is clearly
perfectly usable like this. The crease, your first
crease, is impressively small and very easy to ignore when
you're actually using it. But yeah, thin bezels all the way around. Again, blacked-out pixels on the far left-hand side this time. And there's also still a couple
little folding phone tricks, like, of course, since the
main camera is on the back and there's no selfie
camera on these two panes, then this is the perfect
time to take a selfie with the main camera, but get a full-sized preview
on the 6.4-inch screen that's still wrapped
around the other side. And they are really good flagship quality triple cameras, by the way. I'll get to that in a second. You, of course, get all the other benefits of the display spec: the
brightness, the 90 hertz. It's really solid. Obviously, it's just a little awkward that, like, it's twice as
thick in one hand as the other, which is a little unbalanced. And then, it is glass on one side and then, the, like, sort of
leather material on the other. So, it's a little bit weird in that way, but honestly, still very impressive. I feel like this is
like a seven out of 10. Still pretty close, but
you know, we're not done. So this is what we're all here for, the final fold, which opens this thing up to a full 10.2-inch
corner-to-corner display. So this is now a full 3,184 by 2,232 90-hertz OLED display, thin bezels all the way around, amazingly, with a hole-punch selfie
camera over to the left side, two creases, two hinges. And yeah, this is not an iPad Mini-sized screen in your pocket. This is literally a full-sized 10-inch tablet in your pocket,
which is actually incredible. Now, the more you play with it, the more you start to
notice little quirks, like, first of all, it's ridiculously thin now that it's all open. It's actually kind of
disorienting to hold the tablet with a screen this big,
but bezels this small, and, like, the whole thing is this thin, it's just kind of a marvel. And then you look at the creases plural, 'cause now you got two, and you can actually see
there is a small difference between the inward folding
crease on the right side and the outward folding
crease on the left. But they are also, actually,
both impressively small. But, like, yeah, this... I'm actually kind of
sad that I can't, like, fully daily drive something
like this 'cause it is Huawei. Like, you can kind of hack your way into getting some Google services on here. But a lot of this UI, a lot of this OS is still Chinese only. Like, it's not gonna be great. It's probably missing
some bands in the US, too. But just, wow. It's a good amount of software tweaks for the triple-fold thing, too. Like when you fully unfold
it, the whole UI stretches out but is still one page on each side. So they've kind of just
played this animation to stretch out two pages
among three panels, but the animation's pretty smooth. And there is a wrong way to
fold it, too, by the way. And it tells you about it. So obviously, you can
close it pretty easily. The correct way to unfold it is to get the two on the inside, but if you unfold it the
wrong way, like that, it actually tells you. It says, ""Fold it a different way to use the device, please. You're kind of doing
something weird here."" Which totally fair, I'll
get it right next time. You kind of have to... There is a little learning
curve to according... ""According?"" Accordioning quickly every time. But yeah, this has to be a 10 out of 10. I mean, there's the fact
that I'm able to fit a, look at the size of
this, a 10-inch display, reasonably in my pocket. That by itself is something
that no other device can do. So I gotta love that. Another question I had early
when playing with this is... I mean, people put cases on every phone. What are cases for this phone like? Turns out it does come
with a case in the box, which is this thing. And so, really, it is just
one back piece of the phone that it can protect
when it's fully closed. So this case snaps onto the
back of the phone like this and then protects also a little
bit of the exposed screen on the side, so it makes sense. They don't wanna get any debris in there. And then it has a kickstand on the back, which can rotate around and support it at a couple
of various different angles. So you can watch videos like
this if you're into that. And it can also rotate out of the way to expose the wireless charging coils because it turns out this phone
also has wireless charging, and if you just flip it
sideways on certain charges, you can get it to line up and
work with wireless charging. So that's one type of person who will use the kickstand
built into the case. But there is another type
of person, by the way, a total reckless psycho that
would unfold it like this and then use the phone itself
as a built-in kickstand. And it totally works. Like, the UI responds to it, and you can watch, you know, YouTube on a larger part of the screen, but you're also totally scratching the outside part of the screen
you're using as a kickstand. So yeah, I'm obviously
not gonna recommend that. In case you're also wondering about specs on something like this. It's fit flagship specs inside, despite being these crazy
thin slivers of a phone. It's the flagship
seven-nanometer Kirin 9010 chip made by Huawei. It is also up to 16 gigs of RAM and a terabyte of storage, which is crazy. And triple cameras on
the back, as you can see. That's a 50-megapixel main camera, a 12-megapixel ultra-wide,
and a telephoto. And there's a 5,600
milliamp-hour battery chopped up and distributed in here
with 67-watt fast charging and 50-watt wireless charging,
which is kind of insane. And then the whole thing will retail... It's in China, so if you sort
of do the conversion price, this, like, top-end model
with the terabyte of storage is like $3,500. So $3,000 to $3,500 US. That's actually not
that much more expensive than some of the highest-end
folds that we have. So why is this the only tri-fold phone? Maybe that's the main
question you're wondering after all of this. Because it's so cool. It's just the fact that I can actually fit all of this in the dimensions of something that fits
in my pocket is nuts. And they've done a lot of things with, like, nice software touches that actually make it feel
really well-considered. But yeah, there are also
some trade-offs, of course. I think the biggest weakness on paper is gonna be the battery, the
5,600 milliamp-hour battery. You know, fast charging
is great, obviously, so that can offset it. But the more time you use this wide open with the 10 inches of screen, the tougher that's
gonna be on the battery. You know, if you look at
typical larger tablets, even the thin ones, the 10-inch
tablets are having, like, 8,000-plus milliamp-hour
batteries pretty often. So that's probably the
biggest weakness here. The speakers are also truly terrible. It's interesting 'cause they come out of the right-hand corner
and the left-hand corner when it's open, but it's
so thin, there's just... It's physics, there's not enough room for big chambers for huge speakers. So, yeah, the speakers are
pretty tinny, pretty bad. And then, there is no IP rating for dust or water resistance. Some of the newer foldables
have water resistance now. This one, not so much. And then, of course, the price is obviously gonna keep some people away. But honestly, that's a pretty
small list of trade-offs for something that is so,
like, shockingly different and new, that I'm impressed. This had the potential to be like the world's greatest concept phone. Remember concept phones
from a couple years ago? I was like, it's getting kind of weird that people are, like, showing off phones they're never gonna make. This could have been the
coolest concept phone ever. But then they just went and decided to actually make
a bunch of them and ship 'em. This phone also just happens to have a variable aperture
lens on the main camera, so it can switch between f/1.4 wide open for some real background bokeh to f/4 and getting more things in focus. It happens to also have
that insanely fast charging. It comes with an 80-watt charging brick, and it has fast wireless charging in a body barely thick enough
to have an entire USB-C port. It happens to come with this
pre-installed screen protector that I'm just never gonna remove. It's crazy. There's just so much going on here that in this world of so

different from last year. Not a whole lot has changed,"" I gotta hand it to projects like this. This is just insane. (laughs) They didn't have to go this hard. They didn't have to go
this hard, but they did. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys in the next one. Peace. (bright electronic music)","(shapes springing) (bright electronic music) - All right, so you've heard of flipping phones, you've heard of folding phones, but technology never slows down. So welcome to a phone with both. The world's first tri-fold phone. This thing, this is the Huawei Mate XT, is what it's called. So I'd heard about this thing, I'd seen some videos online, but it was also a Huawei phone, so it was China-only. So knowing that I'm never",0.2942,0.999,0.664
@mkbhd,Diamond,nK9zxuXa3OA,Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold Is So Good! But…,"(upbeat music) - All right, so first thing I did when I got back from Australia was start to catch up on the stuff that I missed. And I put my SIM card in the Pixel Fold, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and
I was impressed, really. Maybe I shouldn't have been so impressed given how good the other
Pixel 9s already are. But it's a folding phone,
folding phones are hard, but the second generation
of anything tells you a lot. And even though this is called the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, it's the second one. The first Pixel Fold is
last year and it was solid. It was one of my favorite
foldables to use closed with that passport style aspect ratio, but it had a number of
trade-offs with its price. This one makes some big strides forward. So let me just start with the design. Like there was a lot of
chatter about this camera bump on the back just 'cause
of the way it looks, which is, yeah, it's kind of weird. But personally this hasn't bothered me. It's not like the biggest wobbler. I wish it was wider like the other Pixels, I wish it looked more consistent
like the Pixel 9 and 9 Pro, but you don't have to look at it much. I'm guessing it looks like this just 'cause of the complicated
internals of a folding phone. But then the rest of the design around this thing is pretty nice. It is much thinner, first of all, and they've flattened the
sides all the way around. So it's this more modern
like squared off shape a lot of other flagships have. Now, the funny thing is the rounded sides from last year were actually easier to just pry open for a folding phone. So you'll notice that if you
use both phones back to back, but this isn't the end of the world. And then, there's a bunch
of other refinements too. The hinge is a bit smaller. The sides are now sort of
matte finish instead of glossy. So now, you have matte
sides and a soft touch back. And overall, it just feels much closer to a normal slab when it's closed. It's not fully there, like
we're not quite fooling anybody yet, but it's a little over 10 millimeters thick folded and there are a lot of other phones from the past year that
are around that number. The main change though
definitely is that it's not that smaller passport size anymore. This is a full on like
maxed out flagship size, 6.3 inch, 1080p, dynamic
120 hertz AmLED display. It's big, the last one was
more reachable, for sure. Now it's much more like
the OnePlus Open sized. So it's right around the maximum of actually being able to use the whole screen with one hand. I mean your mileage may vary of course, depending on the size of your hands. But yeah, there's also still real bezels all the way around the screen
and it kind of pushes it away from the hinge so
it's a little off center. But in general, I still
find it very usable and it just feels more
like a regular phone than ever before, which I think is a win. I really like this cover screen. And then when you open it
up, that's when the benefits of being taller really start to pay off 'cause now you go from a 7.6 inch screen to a slightly narrower
but taller 8 inch screen that's basically now a square. And the screen is way
better, it's up to 2700 nits. It's nice and bright. It is actually LTPO when the cover screen is not, for some reason and the bezels have tremendously improved
from the first folding Pixel. So they're still a little thick, sure, but now they're nicely
even all the way around and there's a whole punch
cutout in the corner now instead of the selfie
camera on the thick bezel. And just look how thin that is. Like it's barely thicker
than the USB C port. This would've been a crazy sentence just a few short years
ago, but using this phone I wager almost everything about the hardware of this Google phone is at or above average, which is crazy. It's like the harder the part is to make the better and more
above average they are. Like this new hinge is nice and smooth and the phone opens and closes
in a really satisfying way and it unfolds all the way flat easily, unlike last year's phone. The crease through the
middle is, you know, average at worst, but
very easy to look past when you're actually looking
at content on the screen. And they fit in a 4650
milliampere-hour battery inside, which again is a little
above average for foldables, even though it's actually
slightly less than last year. The speakers in this thin
body are very good and full. The water resistance is here, it's IPX8. The flatter fingerprint reader
is easy and quick and fast. And just this hardware feels actually more deserving of the
word pro than ever before. So you know, they renamed the phone, it has pro in the name now, but it feels like it deserves it. But also little things
like the outer display not being LTPO feel weird considering that's the one that does
the always on thing. That's the one you really want to be LTPO. And it also doesn't
charge particularly fast and there's no Qi2 so the phone has this lower than normal
wireless charging coil that can be kind of annoying to line up and doesn't work on certain chargers, which may feel like nitpicking but hey, when it's an $1800 phone, you are definitely allowed to nitpick. Overall though, design wise, I really feel like they
got a lot of stuff right. So yeah, it reminds me of the
OnePlus Open from last year, which won my best folding
phone of the year. But then this one is a Pixel and this Pixel software
experience ends up being what differentiates it over a lot of other folding phone options out there because yeah, there are
totally more flashy foldables with more advanced hardware
from Vivo and Xiaomi and there's these razor thin pieces of hardware with head turning specs. But if I'm being honest, the software on those typically isn't nearly as good. So here you basically
have all the same features as the rest of the Pixel 9
flagship lineup, which is great. It's call screening, it's
the Pixel weather app, it's all the new stuff
basically, everything except the thermometer app and that's fine. So Gemini is actually getting good, like I said in the 9 review, and I'm still loving circle to search, although on this inner
screen you gotta be slightly more careful because the slight difference between hold to circle to search and the tiny swipe to bring up the dock can kind of take some getting used to. But then there's also all of
the foldable optimizations, the two column layouts for
so many pieces of Android, the notifications, the settings app, so many other first party apps. And I've just been generally loving the larger size screen because
it feels like multitasking and having multiple apps open at once. Or specifically something I do a lot, which is picture in picture with a small YouTube video window
somewhere on the screen, but I'm reading an article
or doing something else in a full-size window, all of that is better on this phone than last year. And this is all Android
14, which is the same as all the other new Pixels,
but I put Android 15 beta on my old Pixel Fold and there are some more folding
optimizations that's just... It's hopefully, coming soon
and they promise seven years of software updates on Pixel
9s, which is pretty elite. So I've said a lot of nice
things about this phone, but going into this before I
even put my SIM card in it, 'cause I'd read other people's coverage and seen stuff about this phone is I knew that there would be
basically two main downsides to look out for, to keep an eye on. And those are the Tensor
chip being underpowered and the downgraded camera system. So, okay, it's a Pixel, let's
just start with the cameras. Basically, my findings are, yes, they are smaller sensors
than the main Pixels and yes, they are worse,
but they're not horrible. Like they're not that much worse
that it's a bad camera now. Basically, you can see the
style of the photos is the same and it's contrasty,
it's high dynamic range, but it's not as sharp
is my main observation. And this gets exaggerated
as the conditions get worse. So in lower light the photos get softer and lack details faster
as these smaller sensors start to fight for light more. So it feels on par with
like a Pixel flagship, but from a few years
ago, like a Pixel 7 Pro. Now that's about it and that's always been one of the compromises of
these high-end folding phones is, you know, they give you
all the software features of the other phones, but for 17, $1800 you would also hope for
the maximum quality, but they can't fit all of
the same camera sensors in a phone that has
all this other hardware and a hinge and everything like that. So if you take a lot of pictures and you're into phones
specifically for that, that might be a tough pill to swallow. But if you're not, if you
buy it for other reasons and you're not a huge camera person, then you may be willing to overlook that. Me, personally, I rely too much on photos and videos from my phone,
so that's tough for me. But the other downside
is this Tensor chip, and this is another nuanced one. See, Google's Tensor chip has never been best in its class power-wise
or efficiency-wise. I'd argue it's been good enough
for the phones it's been in. But if you wanted to
do like high-end gaming or if you wanted a really
extended shelf life for more than a few years or really amazing battery life, like Tensor is holding these phones back. And so, people have been
trying to figure out, all right, when is
Google going to catch up and get on par with like the
Qualcomm level flagship chips and the Tensor G4 in the
Pixel 9 line of phones, including this phone, is solid and it's paired with 16
gigs of RAM in this phone, which is awesome and obviously
helps with the AI models, but also running the rest of the phone. But it's not amazing and
it really makes you wonder like, okay, it's promised seven
years of software updates, but will the phone last that long? Like these are real questions. But word on the street is
next gen, next Tensor chip, allegedly, maybe is gonna be the one that finally goes from being designed by Google and manufactured by Samsung to the first fully custom Google chip with three nanometers and everything. And that could be the
huge jump that this needs. That could be a big power jump, a big efficiency jump,
but that's just a rumor. So I would say that if you hear that and get excited about that
which, let's be honest, a lot of the customer base
for a $2,000 folding phone actually does care about that stuff then, you should probably wait. I actually feel like you should wait. And it's weird to say
that this is both one of the best folding phones I've ever used and you should probably wait just because you don't wanna spend this much and then regret your purchase next year. But if that doesn't
speak to you, honestly, this phone as it exists
today, it feels great. It looks great, it's
smooth, the battery life, for me, is consistently like
six hours of screen on time with mostly small screen activities, but then the sort of 10% of the time that I actually open it and
do a lot more big screen use, then you can eat into
the battery a bit more. But I just feel like I am
productive when I have this phone. Like it really does accomplish the goal of feeling like I have two phones, the regular size flagship
when it's closed, and then the mini tablet
ready to go at any time for the multi column
layouts, the multitasking and big productivity
apps, for all that stuff that I really sit down and get stuff done on my phone for, this
thing has been awesome. Oh, and also speaking of
ready to go at any time, I just wanted to shout out
that the new Ridge Wallet that I designed is finally here and it is a full grain leather
soft wallet and it's sick. RFID blocking, lightweight,
two pockets with easy access. You can kind of just pop
'em up from the front or use your finger to glide
them up from the back. Fits up to around eight cards. You could put cash in
it, if you want to also. It's everything you need
and nothing you don't. I'll link it below if
you wanna check it out. I'm really proud of it. But yeah, look, if you're
not a foldable person, then this phone may not convince you. Like it's the same dimensions, the same functionality, roughly. Like it's not a game
changer, by any means. But if you are a foldable person, this phone has been awesome to use. Like I've really enjoyed the fact that it really feels like a
full on flagship on the front and feels like a mini
tablet when I want one. Two phones in one, that's the
ideal foldable phone for me. And yeah, this is my favorite
flagship foldable ever to come out so there you have it. Hopefully, Android 15 soon. Thanks for watching, catch
you in the next one, peace. (upbeat music)","(upbeat music) - All right, so first thing I did when I got back from Australia was start to catch up on the stuff that I missed.

@mkbhd,Diamond,MRtg6A1f2Ko,iPhone 16/16 Pro Review: Times Have Changed!,"- [Tim] A widescreen
iPod with touch controls, a revolutionary mobile phone, and a breakthrough internet
communications device. (energetic music) (phone vibrating) Profound new intelligence capabilities that will make our platforms even smarter. - So this is the iPhone 16, and this is the iPhone 16 Pro. Brand new, and I've been testing them for about two weeks now. But you know what I've been
doing way longer than two weeks? Working on a new app that
we are finally launching. You guys have always been asking me where I get my wallpapers. Like, it's frequently the number
one suggested search result under my name, has been for years. So now we've put them all in one place. It's called Panels. And it's finally live in the App Store, both on iOS and on Android. Feels really good to be able to say that. So if you're wondering where
the wallpaper on these phones in the review came from, Panels. If you're wondering where the wallpaper in the last video came from, Panels. Matter of fact, almost all of
the wallpapers on the devices and in backgrounds
you've seen in my videos for the past year have
all come from Panels, which is pretty sick. We have a bunch of
awesome artists over there that we are splitting profits with 50-50. And there's already a ton
of great collections of art and much more incoming. And we have some pretty
big plans for this thing. So it's starting off
as a wallpaper app now. I don't want to over promise too much, but it's going to be pretty
consistently improving over time, which is part of the reason why we're offering a
subscription to support it. So go pick it up now. Poke around, find your
new favorite wallpaper, your new favorite artist, and
lemme know what you think. It's kind of fun to be
on the other side now, on the development side, where now other people are
gonna review what we make, which is always exciting. Anyway, so the meta with
new smartphones these days is a bunch of incremental
hardware improvements and then a whole bunch of AI features that also are being added on top, which is where the real value is. And while they're a
little late to the game, Apple has hit that chapter
too with the iPhone, whether we like it or not. So the iPhone 16 is a minor,
minor update over the 15, but with a ton of new AI stuff
labeled Apple Intelligence. Except that stuff's not here
yet, which is a little awkward considering basically all of
the marketing for this phone is Apple Intelligence stuff. Like, I've seen billboards touting that as the new thing here. Their whole event was
about how it's Glowtime, which is a reference to the
new glowing Siri animation. But none of that stuff is
on this phone, none of it. So the only way to square the
state of this phone right now with everything Apple
has said about this phone is that it's unfinished. Like, this is the most unfinished I've ever seen a new iPhone launch. So until we actually have all
that Apple Intelligence stuff, we are left with a very
incremental upgrade cycle. (cheerful music) So there's not a lot
actually physically new with this year's iPhone,
but it's not nothing. So the iPhone 16 looks a little different from the iPhone 15. There was a moment in
time not that long ago where Apple removed the headphone jack, and then there was a ton of speculation about them maybe removing all
the ports and all the buttons. But instead it's gone the opposite way and they've added the action
button from last year's Pros and yet another button
called Camera Control, which we'll get to in a second. Aesthetically, though, there are some really poppy new colors and slightly larger protruding cameras lined up on the back of the phone. And, okay, I know everyone
puts a case on their phone, so this is probably nothing, but I think this is the
wobbliest slab phone I have ever seen, or at
least that I can remember. But either way, the rest of the
general shape and flat sides and dimensions of this phone
are basically the same. It's very familiar iPhone. The Pro phones are even
harder to tell apart, but they do have new
displays and they're great. So they're slightly bigger, 6.3
and 6.9 inches respectively. And the bezels are, I think,
actually noticeably thinner and still even all the way around. So both sized phones are just
a little larger than last year and fit bigger batteries too. And we should talk about batteries. So when Apple unveiled
all these new phones, they made kind of a big deal about how they all have slightly
larger capacity batteries across the board, and that the new Pro Max would have the longest battery
life ever in an iPhone. Which I mean, I would hope that
your newest, most expensive, most high tech, biggest phone
ever has the longest battery, but still, they didn't give
any numbers to support that. So we don't actually know how much larger in
milliamp-hours the battery is or how much longer the
battery actually lasts. All I have to go on is Apple's
website's comparison tool, which only measures in
video playback hours. So it has the iPhone 16 at
22 hours of video playback up from 20, and the 16 Pro Max
is all the way up to 33 hours versus last year's big phone's 29. Unfortunately, this means
almost nothing to me because video playback can be optimized with like, cores on a chip. Who cares? But now the phones are out
and people have gotten them and torn 'em apart, measured 'em. Turns out the batteries are
about 6% larger across the board and 9% larger on the Pro. And I've found battery life
about the same as last year, to be honest. Like, not noticeably better,
not noticeably worse. I end up saying a lot of
the same things about it, like it lasts me a whole day on the Pro, heavy use, no problem. What actually did make a
difference to me, though, is faster charging. Less people are talking about it, but all of the new iPhone 16 lineup supports up to 45 watt wired charging now. Apple never talks about fast charging, they never brag about like, how fast you can go 0%
to 100% or 0% to 80%, but when their phones do get
slightly faster at charging, it's pretty nice. It's too bad it doesn't come
with a fast charging brick in the box. But I have a fast charger. I am loving the new
fast charging in bursts. And also MagSafe supports,
with the new puck, up to 25 watt wireless
charging instead of 15. On the inside, these phones
have the A18 and A18 Pro chips. And again, I'd be lying if I told you I just noticed any
difference right out the box and I think basically anybody would. But yes, they will benchmark
10%, 20%, 30% faster depending on what you ask it to do. But the extra power is definitely more about fringe activities, high-end stuff, future-proofing. I was actually more curious, though, to find that all of the models
have eight gigs of RAM now. So the Pro phones and the non-Pro phones, which usually have different amounts. No doubt this is because the
Apple Intelligence features, when they eventually ship, are going to need every last bit of it. But for now, hey, you can enjoy more RAM for all your other apps too. IOS 18 launched with these new phones too. So I made an entire
separate video about iOS 18, all the new features. That's what's rolling out to everybody's older
iPhones as well now too. So you can put your home
screen icons wherever, you can color your home screen icons, you can change your lock screen shortcuts, basically customize the iPhone
a bit more than ever before. You could argue this makes a
bigger difference to the iPhone than any of the other hardware stuff. But yeah, I'll link that full video below. But speaking of new hardware,
there is one other new button. (energetic music) So I guess nobody at Apple is
allowed to call it a button, but I'm gonna call it a button. So this is the new Camera Control button on all of the new iPhone 16's. I've used and played with and thought a lot about this button. And actually, it all comes down to smartphone cameras in general. My take is that smartphone
cameras are like headphones' EQ. Like, you get a new pair
of headphones out the box and you listen to 'em, you don't like 'em, oh no, no, don't worry. That's just one of the ways
that these headphones can sound. You can change the EQ and it'll sound like a totally
different pair of headphones. And that's also true
with smartphone cameras, this year more than ever with the iPhone. So the default photos from the iPhone look more iPhoney than ever. Remember how every year in the
blind smartphone camera test the iPhone loses because it kind of overly
brightens all the shadows and it doesn't have as much contrast? Yeah, it's still doing that, especially in photos with people in it. But the purpose of this new
button has been made very clear and it's kind of a theme
for the whole phone, which is, well, camera control. This year, Apple's kind
of just giving back control of the camera to
users in an interesting way. But you have to know how to use it. Like, you have to know that
it's a double half press with just the right weight to bring up the sliding
menu of camera controls for things like exposure compensation and zoom and photographic styles and tone. And then play with it enough to realize that tone is actually maybe
the most important one, where turning up tone actually
removes shadows even more but turning down tone
brings real shadows back. But it doesn't seem to have a memory, so you have to remember to set it every time you open the camera app. But you also have this D-pad that lets you change even
more elements of a photo, including undertones and mood and color and really mess around and dial in the look
of the photos you want. And this one does have memory, so every subsequent
time you open the camera it'll remember your color hue and tone. So I found that tone at
around -0.5 is a nice balance for most photos that I've been taking. Feels less flat, more contrasty. This is all really useful to me. And combined with the actual
new cameras on the phones, this has risen the iPhone back to the top of my personal favorite rankings of smartphones to shoot with. I just like having more
control over the camera. Camera control. But it is really finicky. Like, the placement on the side
of the phone for the button is mostly ideal for landscape, but would definitely be easier to reach if it was closer to the corner. But if we're being honest, most people take photos and
videos in portrait these days and the corner would be
horrible for portrait, so they split the difference
and moved it up a bit so you could reach it. But it's still not great. And the half press
sensitivity takes some time to really get used to. I'm on week three now, and I'm still accidentally taking pictures by tapping too hard. And the scrolling, it has momentum physics and you can accidentally scroll too far and go past the thing you were targeting in this more continuous
scrolling interface. It is just finicky enough
and just hidden enough that I honestly think like, 99% of people will never use this for anything other than just
a camera shutter button. And I guess that's fine too. I personally did quickly get used to opening the camera quickly
with the Camera Control button. And so I remapped my action button to something else, my Tasks app. And I've also remapped
my lock screen shortcut so it's now flashlight
and my Tasks app again. And you can always just
swipe over sideways from the lock screen and
get to the stock camera app. So if you really want, you can
map the Camera Control button to open any other camera
app on your phone, or just keep waiting for
Apple Intelligence features that this will probably
make more sense for. So yeah, long story
short, one, it's a button. Two, it's also a customization slider. Three, it's just gonna be
a button for most people. But also four, there are
new cameras on the back. (bright music) So there's a bunch of new
cameras across the line for both iPhone 16 and 16 Pro. Best way to summarize it, okay, so iPhone 16's cameras are nice, like they're pretty solid main cameras, very much in character
with iPhones of the past but not noticeably better
than previous years. And then the 16 Pro cameras
with the much bigger main sensor and the higher resolution
ultrawide and the 5X telephoto are a significant step up, in my opinion. The main camera I think is
my favorite primary sensor in any smartphone to shoot with right now. It's really good at basically everything. The ultrawide is also better, but kind of only in
detail during the daytime since it's a 48 megapixel sensor now. But the sensor's not bigger enough to matter at night, though. And now my night ultrawides all look kind of
vignetted for some reason. I mean, look at that, it
looks like I added a filter. But then the 5X telephoto on
both the Pros is also nice now. And there is some chatter
about it being worse at the 3X to 4X range because you're still
having to do digital zoom. And technically that's true, but I find the 5X to be
a pretty useful zoom. And it's also better at
resolving all the detail past 5X than before, even without AI. Shutter speeds are super fast and freeze action better than ever before. This is kind of underrated,
but I love this. Like, this shot came from a
moving car at highway speed, and so did this one, so that's sick. And the ease at which you can
get a shallow depth of field with a closeup subject is on par with any other
big sensor Android flagship like S24 Ultra or Pixel 9 Pro. And no, Apple has absolutely
not fixed the lens flare issue with point lights at night. So for those who are wondering, sorry. But aside from that,
video is very impressive. I'll be publishing the
next Auto Focus video on the Silverado EV
pickup truck pretty soon, so subscribe over there
for that, first of all. But that's gonna be shot
entirely on iPhone 16 Pro and I've been very happy with it. And Apple also added a 4K 120
FPS mode to the Pro phones, and it's sick. It looks great. It is really convenient to shoot and edit. The only thing you gotta
be careful with is storage, 'cause it can really eat up storage. Like, you can get up
to near a gig a minute and that's before you even do
4K 120 ProRes or ProRes Log. But yeah, I still love shooting it anyway. It also proves to me that
they have the processing power and the sensor readout speed to do 8K 30, they just choose not to. And I wonder why sometimes. This is also the first year they're using the term Fusion camera. And you kinda have to dig in a little bit to try to figure out what that means. Turns out it's basically the
same thing as last year's, like, punch-in optical quality zoom, but with a slightly updated
image processing pipeline. Cool. But also that zoom is not technically
one-to-one optical quality because the photo sights are
smaller in that smaller crop. Nevertheless, iPhone 16 camera, good. iPhone 16 Pro camera, great. (upbeat music) There is something truly
weird about this product being launched at an Apple
event called Glowtime and not launching with the
thing that glows, the new Siri. There's something weird about people happily going out to a 5th
Avenue Apple store this week which is literally
glowing with rainbows now, and walking out with a brand new phone that doesn't have that. Like, there's something just off about billboards and marketing material all highlighting Apple Intelligence, and Tim Cook saying
this was the first phone built from the ground up
for Apple Intelligence. - The next generation of
iPhone has been designed for Apple Intelligence from the ground up. - Yet this phone does not have
Apple Intelligence at all. It's all coming soon and
coming later this year and into next year eventually
with software updates. But if I've said it once,
I've said it a million times, never buy a product based on the promise of future software updates. Buy it for what it is
right now when you buy it. That's been the golden rule for forever. But yet here we are, times have changed. This has been a common trend alongside AI. And you think Apple might be
immune to it, but they're not. They're a public company. And just like lots of
other public companies, they've sort of caved to this pressure that they have to appear like an AI-first, AI-forward
company, like a leader in AI. So they have presented a ton of AI stuff that they're working on, and
they've done the song and dance of like, ""Hey, we're AI-first and the phone's built
from the ground up for AI. It's our whole theme this year."" But the fact of the matter
is it's not good yet. It's not. It's actually not even finished. If it was, they'd be shipping it. But it's in beta and
they're still working on it and they'd rather keep working on it than ship it to you now. So how do we square this? Do we even square this? You remember the Rabbit R1. The Rabbit was a little AI in a box, pretty classic 2024 product. When I reviewed that Rabbit,
it was basically useless, like literally almost none of
the functionality was working as it shipped. And so I said so in the review. Same with the Humane AI Pin, really, really, really bad product missing almost all of its functionality. Worst product I've ever reviewed for now. Both of those products have
started to get some updates since I reviewed them. But again, I can only review
what's in front of me, like I got that thing in the mail just like real customers are gonna get that thing in the mail, and now it feels like the new iPhone is suddenly in the same boat. So I guess the difference between the Rabbit and the
Humane Pin and the iPhone is, well, one, the iPhone is
a fine standalone product even without the promised stuff. And it's viable and usable, where the other two, not so much. But two is that Apple at
least now has some element of a track record of
developing and shipping things that they promised, where
Humane and Rabbit didn't. So you could argue there's
some dimension of trust to this and that Apple is really leaning heavily on how much you trust them. Because to be honest,
to me it's really bold to be shipping the product
like this without any of these big things that you're promising. Like, they must really
believe in themselves to eventually ship this stuff
so that people aren't mad. But yeah, that's the AI
world we live in, I guess, is that everyone has this pressure to feel like a leader in AI and be shipping all these
new features and stuff. But a lot of it, not that
good yet, not that done yet. So I'm planning an entire separate review of Apple Intelligence as
a whole when it comes out. I've been using some of
the features in 18.1 Beta on my 15 Pro, but even
this is really limited. Like, it's basically just writing tools and the new Siri animation. But they have a long way to go. I'll say get subscribed to see the Apple Intelligence
review when it drops, when it's done, because clearly it's a
big part of this phone. (bright music) So you made it this far into the video, or you skipped ahead to this chapter 'cause you just really wanted an answer on if you should buy these phones or not. Fine either way. So okay, you should buy the iPhone 16 if you're on an iPhone 13 or older and you know, that phone
is on its last legs and you're really looking for
an upgrade to a new iPhone. Fine. Anything newer and it probably won't feel
like it's worth an upgrade. And you should buy the iPhone 16 Pro if you really want a better
phone in cameras or displays. That's really the two places where the Pro shines
over the regular phone. The cheap iPhone really has
never looked better, honestly. It has the Camera Control, it matches the RAM of
the more expensive Pros, it has the more interesting
colors if you're into that. It has the action button now too. And it has the same
brightness of the display and it also goes all
the way down to one nit, just like the Pro screen. Now, I personally cannot use a 60 hertz, $800 phone in 2024. I just can't do it. And there are lots of people just like me who will immediately have
to upgrade to the Pro just for that. But there are also tons of
people who don't even notice or care about ProMotion. Which, I know, it's kinda hard
to wrap my head around too. But for those people, yeah, the base phone is gonna be great. But then as someone who shoots
a lot of photos and videos and you know, social media
stuff, the Auto Focus channel, between all that, the cameras are better enough on the Pros for that to be worth the upgrade for me. But yeah, I still say buy
it for what it is today, not for what it could be tomorrow. And even without any of the AI stuff maybe ever coming to these
phones, they're still rock solid, very, very incremental upgrades. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys in the next one. Peace.

@mkbhd,Diamond,h3BKjZMGoIw,iPhone 16/16 Pro Unboxing: End of an Era!,"(groovy hip-hop music) - So it's a bit of a tradition around here to unbox the newest iPhones
on the day they come out. And we're upholding
this tradition this year to find one single difference
versus last year's unboxings. So we've got four iPhones
here in new colors: iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, which the boxes show
the back of the phones. And then iPhone 16 Pro
and iPhone 16 Pro Max, which show the front. And I'm totally gonna
start with the base phones, the crowd favorites this year. Finally, some colors back
in the iPhone lineup. So, I'm gonna call this
one the flagship color. This is the Ultra Marine iPhone 16. And in the box, you get the USB-C cable, again, braided and high quality, and then a tiny little bit of
paperwork in this pill shape. And then you'll notice no SIM
card tool, same as last year, and no stickers this year. There are no stickers included in the iPhone 16 box at all. Truly the end of an era. They just can't stop removing things, they can't help themselves. But let's get a look at the
pink plus-sized phone, too. These phones are the
same sizes as last year: 6.1 inches for the base,
6.7 inches for the Plus. But with the bigger batteries inside, that's something I'm
really happy to hear about and very curious about in my testing. But really, I'm just happy
we finally have colors back. So the back of the phone,
it's a little more pale, but the glass around the
camera is a bit darker, the rails of the phone are a
bit darker, so this is nice. Same stuff in the box. Now, with these Pro phones, I think there's a reason they show the front of the phone on the box because, if they showed the back, you literally could
not tell the difference versus last year. But hey, at least this one has slightly thinner bezels they can show. And yeah, this year is gonna be the Natural Titanium iPhone 16 Pro. And aside from the lack
of stickers in the box, it's gonna look and feel
basically exactly like a titanium iPhone 15 Pro. Same USB-C cable as the
base phone, as well. Great. But then, this is the
new flagship Pro color. The renders we saw at
first were kind of weird, but this is the official
Desert Titanium color. And you know, all of Apple's phones are, again, a bit more pale on the back, but they have more color on these rails, and that's definitely true again here. It's kind of like a light sand color but also feels similar
to the gold of the past. But there you have it. That's the iPhone 16's
unboxing experience. So, by the time you see this uploaded, that means I am deep
into my iPhone 16 testing and working on the full review. So, definitely, get subscribed
to see that when it drops. But if there are any things that you specifically
wanna see talked about more or that haven't been talked about enough for the review of the phones, let me know in the comment section below. But I can still give you now some quick things that I've
noticed in my first couple days, my first week of testing, some FAQs. So, first up, there is a size
difference versus last year. The base phones are the
same sizes, like I said, 6.1 and 6.7 inches in the same body sizes. But the Pro phones are both bigger. The iPhone 16 Pro goes
from 6.1 to 6.3 inches, and even though it has thinner bezels, yes, the phone is slightly
taller and slightly wider. And then, the iPhone 16 Pro Max goes from 6.7 inches to
6.9 inches diagonally, which is now just an
absolutely gigantic phone. I mean, it was already huge, but it's now even taller and wider. Biggest phone they've ever made. If you look at it next
to the Galaxy S24 Ultra, that's another absolutely
huge phone for some context, and that phone has a stylus in it. So obviously, Apple's put
more battery in this phone, which is great to see. I'm glad they're not going
the opposite direction of, like, making it thinner
or shrinking the batteries. But yeah, just it's
definitely good to know if you're going with the
new Pro Max this year, you are getting a truly huge, like, borderline tablet-sized phone. Also, random tidbit: Thanks to these new
cameras up in the corners, these new iPhones are
big-time table rockers. Like, big-time uneven camera on the back. It's annoying to me 'cause I
type on the table sometimes. Anyway, I've also been
taking some pictures and videos with the new cameras. I'll be taking and
posting many, many more. If you wanna follow me on Instagram, that's where you'll see some more in the next couple of days,
but I'll link that below. My first impression is
it's kind of remarkable how consistent Apple's
image processing pipeline is to get the same look every year. Like a lot of times, we see
companies switch sensors. Even the Pixels switched sensors after using the same old one for a while, and the whole look kind of changed. But it really feels like year over year, no matter how many hardware changes, no matter how many sensor
changes these phones go through, they still just very much
have the iPhone look, which, I mean, makes sense. This just shallower depth of field from the larger physical sensor. I have also run some benchmarks. So these are the new Geekbench 6 scores for the new A18/A18 Pro in these phones, which are new versus last year. Really not noticing, like, a huge difference in performance
with these brand-new phones. Obviously, you're gonna feel
that more at the very high end and in the long term as these phones age. But what Geekbench also did reveal is all of these phones across the board have eight gigs of RAM now. So, there's typically been
different amounts of RAM in the Pro phone versus the regular phone. Now, there's not. Now, they all have eight gigs of RAM. So Apple was giving us a
lot of talk in that keynote about how these are the first phones built from the ground up
for Apple Intelligence. Is that what this means? I mean, you clearly need a lot of memory to run these AI models, and there's also a more
powerful neural engine on all the phones versus last year. So maybe that's a part of it, too. But all that talk and these
phones all launch with iOS 18.0, which has exactly zero Apple
Intelligence features on them at launch out the box. But that's a rant for another day. But clearly, the biggest
physical new change on these new phones is
this added button here. And Apple refused to call
it a button in the keynote and then doubled down. They also did a bunch of,
like, executive interviews on various YouTube channels that you can go watch from that day, and even in those interviews, they continue to refuse
to call it a button. It's so weird. - To just put out the
biggest burning fire, right up front, in the discourse. It is a real button, right? - Ah!
(group laughing) - It's a physical thing
that depresses, right? - I think it's a first of its kind. There is a tactile switch, that
gives you that final click. - So, just to clear it up, it is an actual moving
clicking physical button that is called Camera Control. (laughs) But it's more than a button. It's also made it to all these
phones, not just the Pros. So, let me jump into that. This Camera Control button,
as the name implies, only controls camera-related things. So it's not like another Action button, it's a Camera Control button. You can hit it once it
opens up the camera, you can hit it again to take a photo, and then you can hold it down to start recording a quick video. But it's also a large capacitive touch-sensitive surface with
a vibration motor underneath. So it doesn't actually half-press, but with that vibration motor, it can mimic the feeling of a half-press, like a real camera would have. And you can double-tap to flip through various
camera controls like zoom or photographic styles, or tone. It takes some getting used to. I mean, these swipes, they also you can see
have momentum physics too, so you can swipe too fast or too far and go past what you were aiming for or zoom past where you thought you would. So it can feel a bit finicky and silly as you start using it, especially since you can
literally do all this stuff with the buttons already on the screen. But when you use Camera Control, all of the rest of those
buttons just fade away and disappear, kind of
encouraging you to continue using the Camera Control to find
what you're trying to do. It's really interesting. The placement feels like it was
made with landscape in mind, but landscape ideally
would've been at the corner. But they also know a lot
of people take photos and videos like this, so it can't be all the way at the bottom. So they moved it up. So, it's kind of splitting
the difference here. And also, third-party apps
will be able to plug into it if they use the camera. So this is already working with Kino, and it's supposed to start working with Snapchat pretty soon as well. And you can imagine other
apps that use the camera will just decide what
they wanna do with it. I was also curious, though, and I said this in that
original impressions video, how cases would deal with
this new button surface thing. So it turns out there's
basically two options. Option number one is just a
cutout in the side of the case. Just cut it out, expose it to the finger. So it's fine. That's probably what
most cheap cases will do, but that also means it's
no longer gonna be flush with the side of the case. But then there's option number two, which is what Apple's
first-party cases do, which is putting in this
little insert, which has glass and transfers the capacitance from the button outside of the case to the Camera Control of the phone itself and maintaining that flush feel. And it feels like it works pretty well. The half press still works fine, the swiping still works fine, the vibration motor transfers through. And the Beats by Dre cases
also already have this. Yeah, I'm just gonna say
that again real quick in case you were just
phasing out for a second. There's Beats by Dre iPhone
cases now. (chuckles) Like, since when does Beats make cases? Like, why does Beats make cases? I thought, I don't know,
there was a theme of, like, Beats being audio products, but there's something new going on here. Maybe now they're just iPhone accessories? I don't know. But yeah, they've got a nice little Camera Control button thing
on their new iPhone cases, which is nice. I kind of wish, and I'm not alone, that this was also Touch ID, but then they couldn't call
it Camera Control, I guess. I wonder if that's in the
future of this button. But anyway, speaking of
third-party accessories, that's where dbrand stepped
in to sponsor this video. So, for this sponsor segment,
we're gonna be doing something a little bit different. See, screen protectors,
not my favorite thing. They're kind of a chore to install, between the dust and the
alignment and getting it perfect. That's a big part of why I
don't use them all the time. But that's where channel
sponsor dbrand comes in. They seem to believe that I can install their Prism 2.0 screen
protector blindfolded. So that's what I'm gonna try to do. Instructions that I've been
told are pretty simple. To just get the screen protector, get the phone, and then line it up. Which is like that. (fingers tapping) And then pull the tab like that. (plastic tab rustling) And then just swipe down
the middle to press it down. Give it a couple seconds. And then that should be it. Let's see. Take this off. (installation frame clunking) And that doesn't even
look like it's installed. But it is. It totally is. And it's perfect. Nice. Okay. Yeah, every Prism comes with two of these, so if you get the first one
wrong, you can get a second try. But if you wanna check
these out for the iPhone or any number of phones
that they make for it, I'll have a link below. All right. That's been it. Thanks for watching. Catch you in the next one. Peace.

@unboxtherapy,Diamond,hPf2qu5U6F8,The First Snapdragon ELITE Smartphone...,this is a phone in a bucket of water which seems kind of strange but actually not in this case cuz this is the new gt7 Pro and it's the first of the Snapdragon 8 Elite smartphon so this should be faster than previous generation flagships it's also got a 6500 mAh battery and it's got ip69 water rating that's underwater now start the timer it's been sitting in here mode tells me for 45 minutes and that's because it can handle it according to their documentation up to 2 hours submerged so I think that'll mean this is our very first ever underwater unboxing video I don't think I've done that before I'm fairly certain I haven't done that before oh it's crazy how much it floats so on the back of the buck Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 well this is what they actually ended up calling Snapdragon 8 Elite 50 megap AI camera 50 map 3x camera 120 HZ AMOLED 6500 mAh battery and 120 W fast charging this one is in Galaxy gray but I believe it's also available in like an orange color this box is soaked Sim tool free case in the package here is the phone ooh feels kind of Premium solid metallic feel uh this is the gray color triple camera CA setup over here power volume type-c for the 120 W fast charging Sim slot very flat brick style device with flat edges for a confident grip now since we are charging so quickly here is our 120 w super vuk fast charger and a wet cable now let's go ahead and see if it powers on powered on look oh W it's all ip69 man it's all good all right so we have the device set up now this the gray color you can also get it in this vibrant orange marsik color look at the kind of little lines in there a little slight reflectiveness to it if you want to be more vibrant it actually changes the color of the frame of the device also we have some games installed on here and that's because I think really the story is the new Snapdragon 8 Elite and what it's capable of if you look at this thing in benchmarked it's obviously outperforming the previous generation and it represents a chip that's going to show in a variety of flagships and we just so happen to be seeing it here first in the gt7 Pro so you're going to get high frame rate gaming and the nice thing about that chip is in this case it's paired with a 6500 mAh battery which can also charge quickly so you've got plenty of battery life for any of those labor intensive tasks so let's launch into a game I just noticed this comes with a screen protector on it I don't want to have that there I'm just going to get rid of that this has obviously some sort of dynamic setting for screen re refresh where it can shift between 120 and 60 for battery consumption battery savings you can also lock it in 120 if we launch a game here it should go up to 120 I can swipe in from the left part of the screen hyper boost I can see my temps my frame rate and I can also change my mode from balance to GT because I want even more frames what else game Focus mode this will limit the number of notifications obviously I can do screen recording in here lots of game specific things game filters voice changers for the gamers of course yeah pretty much locked at 60 frames we take it I should jump out okay speakers on here let's Max them out what we got stereo is definitely there it's just bot City anyway use my game sir that's what I'm going to do do sick yes there we go run [Applause] broe Rodrigo flying I need to maybe increase the difficulty level is it that tiny there a touch they've seen it before they'll see it again oh Stone I'm going to snap photos of Mo 1X 2x 6 what if I switch to video I'll do that too 80 108030 no thanks what about 4K 60 that's Mo that's Mo and it's 4 K 60 that's Mo that's Mo that's Mo and it's 4K 60 that's Mo that's Mo that's Mo and it's 4K 60 that's Mo that's Lou that's Lou go on that's Lou no 4K 60 that's Lou that's Lou go on that's l no 4K 60 that's Lou so it's got a 3X telephoto that is a 50 megapix IMX 8822 in sensor which is the biggest 3x telephoto sensor in this price range according to realy the main camera 50 megapixels as well 1 over 156 for the sensor size that's an IMX 906 you have a wide angle on their 8 megapixel IMX 355 it's got an underwater mode which is cool considering it's extremely high IP rating this is the industry's first allaround underwater mode yeah I'm just noticing that now there's a a kind of red accent around the camera section it's subtle but it's there it's got a bunch of AI features AI snap mode AI sketch to image AI motion de blur AI Zoom Clarity that's the bad guys B the guys sniper eliminated Target down all right oh really oh I did not expect to get that kill I'm hurt Target down cover me am I getting like reloading taking the lead sniper eliminated Targets in sight reloading cover me oh it's over we win I didn't even describe what this is to people but like this is from a company called gamer that's the X3 Pro and if you have a phone that's this capable and you add some sort of external controller to it it really takes things up a notch plus it doesn't get that hot the phone but if you have a really extended gaming session this thing can plug in and then you have active cooling you have a fan on the back and the whole thing connects via one single type-c port like this yeah listen Snapdragon 8 Elite crazy amount of power you're going to play whatever you want to play on there you've got stereo sound and you've got really fast charging 120 wat boom smart rapid charging super vuk watch go up in real time real time 6500 mAh battery put it in water ip69 all right so there you have it that is the new gt7 Pro from real me let me know in the comments which of these colors you would pick up and if you're excited for the latest Snap Dragon Flagship Snapdragon 8 [Music] Elite wow you got a headlight I wanted to show off my ride I wanted to show off my ride here and you oh I wanted to show off my ride here and you oh oh my God and it's durable that was a pretty heavy fa to be honest on concrete yeah yeah real world still rolling yeah know real world like cool like nothing,this is a phone in a bucket of water which seems kind of strange but actually not in this case cuz this is the new gt7 Pro and it's the first of the Snapdragon 8 Elite smartphon so this should be faster than previous generation flagships it's

@unboxtherapy,Diamond,QptbdEci-m8,Unboxing The 8K Action Camera,so insta 360 has a new Ace Pro the Ace Pro 2 and they've still got that like a badge on the front co-engineered this of course is their 8K AI powered action camera with a flippy display so you can see yourself it looks more rugged than ever they gave me this little slip say 1 over 1.3 the size of the 8K sensor with a Leica lens on it 8K 30 frames per second video 50 megapixel photos and a dual AI chip for Superior image qual quality they claim to have enhanced the low light performance they claim to have enhanced the Windu for Clear audio when recording we can also shoot 4K 60 frames which I think is actually going to be more useful for more people than the 8K footage rugged and waterproof to 39 ft 157° wide angle capture of course we've also got our AI editing which is built into the app as well so in 360 actually asked me to show the footage next to the footage from the GoPro 13 black that's how confident they are in their product so you're going to see some samples and you can decide for yourself when you see the image quality comparatively in a couple of different scenarios it looks like it comes with a dual battery bundle which is always kind of nice I presume you can order this in a couple of different kits but two batteries is better than one they've also got very nice smoothing and HDR to keep everything nice and watchable here you can see they call it Flow State stabilized and that Horizon lock is basically like Ma magic this does look different the microphone Grill has changed sticker one sticker two the whole thing feels quite rugged almost like a SLR style camera the display locks into place if you want to keep it locked down in its regular format but then obviously it clicks into place in the front-facing scenario as well so you can easily hold this out see yourself and even if you have it on some sort of an extension selfie stick you can still see yourself on there like a 1 12 six so over 13 we've also got this secondary front display and a large record button on the top power switch over on the other side flip this back down battery fits into this location here and the lid kind of seals into place in order to seal off the battery from moisture and dust and we have a separate door for our USBC as well as our micro SD also in the package a tremendous amount of paperwork which is kind of a classic thing with camera thicker booklets have historically come with cameras and actually some insta 360 stickers as well Think Bold we have our USB C cable with some cable ties a little more robust and remember we have this magnetic connection which at least the first portion of the clip is magnetic so it kind of lines it up for you and then you just click it in so it's both magnetic and mechanical and then in order to release it you have to grab from both sides and pull it out it just makes makes it a little bit more satisfying and a little bit easier than having just one or the other just having a mechanical connection Point instead here we make sure things are lined up and then we're in it's pretty quick and of course you can now attach this to a variety of accessories without the need for any kind of like external case here's our second battery since it's part of the bundle so this one is the Windu and this is the mic cap if you're going to head into water you use this cap and if you're going to be filming in the wind oh I didn't even notice so there's foam on the inside of this clip so that's how that's working so it's not just a perforated Grill there's foam behind there and if you've seen in the past when it comes to reducing wind noise you always have some sort of like a foam or a dead cat that you would clip onto the outside but that's a little bit ugly this is definitely a cleaner solution and it's not going to fall off because it's part of the rigid Grill oh let's do a quick comparison just of the body comparative to the previous generation so this was the Ace Pro and now we have the Ace Pro 2 definitely the standout aspect is this new microphone location and accessory it doesn't really change the form factor all that much because the lens is protruding anyways so integrating that screen I think is a nice thing the record button is now completely circular instead of just being a red circle inside of a square button display looks a little bit larger not the frame of it but the actual active display area the new battery door is way better holy so this is not very satisfying to open and close this the battery battery door on the Ace Pro at least comparatively the new battery door it just there's a little click and the release is much more confidence inspiring you hear that little click yeah they really improved it so Mo has now taken the ace2 pro out and put it through its paces and I am going to examine the footage comparative to the latest GoPro see if I can spot the differences and also just talk about some of the improvements they've made in the Ace Pro 2 because there are a number of upgrades incl including the new 1 over 1.3 sensor this is the 8K 30 footage look at the beautiful autumn colors plenty of detail here from an action camera stabilization as well we have extremely vibrant I mean obviously the fall leaves help with that but very vibrant saturated colors and tremendous detail it's 8K 3030 my display is not even 8K [Music] but oh you a rabbit the rabbit's like what are you doing with this action camera in the like you're in the bush man he thinks he's being hunted right now in 8k most showcasing how when you start with 8K you still got more you've got more reach in post because you can go to 2X and it's still still good enough to use which on an action camera is kind of nice because you want to be as wide as possible so you don't miss the action but then when you're editing it you might want to bring people into a closer point because it's just so wide and hard to to tell what's going on but when you start with AK to begin with you can easily do a 2X crop and here we have 4K 120 how you have so many leaves fall you threw those up in the air yeah you're just making wallpapers right now like video wallpapers screen savers that's beautiful so this is what they call 4K Clarity zoom and this is this is not in post this is a double tap on the display in order to engage the 4K Clarity Zoom 4K 30 HDR HDR yeah so in this case what Mo's doing is he's trying to have a ton of contrast in the image so the sun is actually in the frame obviously going to be blown out and a darker foreground to see how it deals with the shadows in the foreground this is sort of what it's all about for insta 360 it was similar on the Ace Pro even more so on the Ace Pro 2 to highlight the Highlight the low light performance this is of course where the new processing system comes in and obviously the new sensor as you can see wow that's this is what time of day is this this is night this is like how late is this 5 in the morning this is 5: in the morning damn anyway you can sort of Spot the Difference here and the other benefit that's happening is because the system is getting more information because of the low light performance it's able to feed more into the stabilizer the ability to discern what's going on but you also end up with a a more stable image with less rattles I mean yeah look man obviously hard to see what's going on in the frame on the right the GoPro frame [Music] and if you have more detail in the image it's going to Aid in the stabilization that's it that's kind of what we're witnessing here turn on gesture control oh that's quick actually now I can see the fact that it's recording because I have a red light on the front and I can go ahead and stop the recording ing that's just really crisp and fast start [Music] recording very quick easy stop recording take a [Music] photo this thing's good very very coherent like there's no lag or processing time start recording Mark that clip stop recording so that's the new insta 360 Ace Pro 2 co-engineered with like 8K on an action camera now at 30 frames also ton of other useful functions and features 4K 120 pure video 4K 60 which I would probably shoot in a lot myself the better design on the wind screen the big sensor the low light performance let me know what you guys think in the coms comments is this your next action camera,so insta 360 has a new Ace Pro the Ace Pro 2 and they've still got that like a badge on the front co-engineered this of course is their 8K AI powered action camera with a flippy display so you can see yourself it looks more rugged than ever they gave me this little slip say 1 over 1.3 the size of

airpods 4 with active noise cancellation they cost more money 129 versus 179 and then the question is is it worth the extra 50 bucks in order to get the noise cancellation when you're talking about a headphone that isn't an inear to begin with that's going to be the most major noise cancellor is the fit and the fact that it seals you off from the external world now if you want to do that you've of course got the airpods pro which I mean for what they are they do what they claim to do they're expensive these are $2.49 though you can find them on promotions this is going to give you that more extreme noise cancellation it's going to be tough to beat with any kind of product that sits on the outside of the ear rather than inside with an ear tip for a lot of people that doesn't matter because what they're looking for is the most convenient package they're looking for something that they can pop in and out of their ear all day and maybe it limits their ear fatigue because possibly an inear head phone it gets them a little bit sore after a while or maybe they don't want to be that closed off from the world or maybe they use transparency mode more than they use noise cancelling mode they rearrange them slightly like they're not presented in the exact same way so I guess if you work at the Apple Store you can kind of quickly tell the difference it almost looks like they come from different factories cuz even the the black color on the print is different that's odd anyway let's start with the non-noise cancelling version the main thing I'm attempting to do with this video is just figure out if that noise cancelling is significant enough to justify this increase in cost and if it even makes sense on an earbud that isn't a true inear headphon so unboxing experience uh similar so far as expected paperwork the case has gotten smaller from the previous generation airpods and it remains smaller than I'm going to get them mixed up right now it remains smaller than the pro model if portability is the most important thing for you ooh interesting little blue identifier thoughts what does it mean quality control I don't think that's supposed to be on there an unapp like thing it's oh it's like a it's not even a permanent that is odd little tiny sticker on there two pairs of airpods you can hardly tell the difference until you look at the bottom and then you notice that you've got the speaker on the model with noise cancellation noise cancellation isn't the only Improvement you've got wireless charging but then beyond that you're looking at two pairs of headphones that are very very similar with $50 difference now maybe you need a pair of fully wireless earbuds but you don't want to spend Apple prices our partners at ear fund have you covered with their new ear fun air proo 4 ultrac now this gives you an inear airbud like the pro model but for a lot less these things start at 89 bucks they still got lots of features Qualcomm adaptive active noise cancellation support for ldac and AP X lossless there's a six mic array for call Quality and a dedicated app which actually does let you control things like your equalizer so because this is an inear style headphone you get a bunch of ear tips to choose from and there's USB cable to charge up the case we have a triple led setup there is your inear earbud very lightweight and already because it's an inear Style with a silicone tip I'm getting tremendous isolation without even using the active noise cancellation I mean there's just a reality of having an isolating in earbud you can't replicate that punch with a earbud that doesn't sit in the ear canal period and you get the base because of it so you want fully wireless inar earbuds with a variety of tips so you can get the best seal check out our partners at ear fun now the other question is Comfort people like the fact that it's just in and out and it doesn't really you know sit too far in the ear maybe you forget that you're wearing it this for me is extremely com able and it doesn't it's not going to fall out it's definitely not going to fall out let me connect this so this is the model with noise cancellation switch between listening modes press and hold okay there's noise cancelling now I can get a sense for the noise cancelling go ahead and talko testing 12 yeah testing one 12 I mean I can hear him I'm not playing music at the moment though so like it is a good test for noise cancelling but obviously when you're also listening to something it's going to drown out whatever he's talking about it's doing something but it's nowhere near as significant as the inear airpods pro now here's conversation awareness when you start speaking airpods will lower the volume of the media which is cool reduce background noise and then enhance the voices okay so sure we'll do that so now it knows that I'm speaking and it's like kind of like an auto transparency mode which is pumping Mo through the earbuds testing 1 23 it's extremely clear this transparency mode is awesome but uh part of it is because the earbud itself is not really sealing off the ear con now like it's just really easy in and out the regular airpod is as much a convenience headphone a daily headphone kind of in Awareness headphone as much as it is about sound quality performance isolation and so forth you see people wearing these things like almost permanently throughout the day this is like in the office video conferencing on and off traveling on public transit like this he just puts much more emphasis on awareness in my opinion okay now let's give a little listen here turn up the volume a little bit and that's interesting so the talking and all of a sudden it's getting quiet very solid performance there it's kind of gradual takes a little while takes a little too long to come back but I guess how I mean that'll be difficult to program that because the assumption is if I open my mouth I'm waiting for respon response so in that case it should take a little while before it comes back not in public you're insane a part of the song comes on they can't hear you so I'm going to have to reiterate what he's saying MO is saying right now that this feature drives him nuts because when he's alone cleaning his apartment with airpods Pro in his ears he hates it that his sing along turns the music down the type of problems that Mo concerns himself with you know when you're cleaning your apartment alone with your airpods on blast I hate the situ problem of noise cancelling in private when I'm by myself that drives me crazy because I I feel that something's going to happen that I'm not going to hear a knock at the door somebody screaming an emergency of some kind the dog is choking on something like I think that's one of this is one of my worst nightmares I missed out on the huge opportunity or the chance to help because I was so noise cancelled and I have babies like small babies so I'm like when am going to be sorry I I can't hear you on purpose on purpose I can't hear you okay nothing now you talk testing 1 two 3 okay I hear you okay noise cancelling now you talk testing 1 two 3 testing 1 two 3 testing now it's off go testing 1 two 3 testing 1 two 3 I'm going to go half volume talk testing two 3 testing 2 3 testing 1 two 3 testing one two 3 it's subtle it's a subtle it's a subtle thing I do like the transparency aspect the noise cancelling it's a subtle I mean you're going to have to have them cranked and noise cancelling and then maybe it's going to let me do that and cranked now go yeah now he's gone but that's full max volume total they sound better than previous generation base airpods to me it's the type of fit where you just kind of forget you're wearing it at least for me and for my ears it's kind of lightweight and it it just I don't know I would forget that I was wearing I think that's the idea of it it gets a little bit less filthy than the inar ones depending on your ear wax situation like it since it doesn't fit so deeply in there now what I want to do is just grab the other ones and just make sure they sound the same minus the noise cancellation talko testing one two three testing one two three testing one two three you know I'm trying to make a recommendation here uh I guess my recommendation is just to go to for the regular airpods 4 that's kind of what this model is designed for the easy inexpensive Wireless earbud that works with all your Apple devices has decent battery life and fits most ears without having to sit too deeply in there like that's the airpods 4 they give you enough products to choose from at a variety of price points because you probably have an idea of what you want to spend and I do think for some people that value is going to be worth it to spend the extra 50 bucks but for me then that's like okay you spent the 50 go up to the pro get the full in ear and get that really substantial jump in noise cancellation now the reason for the treadmill this was Mo's idea to see if they would stay in my ears when I'm running I'm sure that they will but this is my ears everybody's ears are different let's go find out they're not going to budge like I had I have to go a lot faster than this maybe no like for my ear at least could be different for you now the other cool thing you can do with airpods is you can throw a later case on them because you might not love the existing look of airpods or you might just be bothered by the fact that so many people have the exact same looking set that they're easy to confuse with your friend's set of airpods we do actually have cases for the new fours look how easy that slaps on and now you have your own exclusive airpods with a nice Kevlar protection it's still super thin but now you're not going to confuse your airpods for with somebody else's shout out to the entire latercase team,so I've been meaning to try out these new airpods airpods 4 it's a little confusing there's more than one version airpods 4 airpods 4 with active noise cancellation they cost more money 129 versus 179 and then the question is is it worth the extra 50 bucks in order to get the noise cancellation when you're talking about a headphone that isn't an inear to begin with that's going to be the most major,0.0,0.9986,0.4576
@unboxtherapy,Diamond,G7o7Qz08RrI,Unboxing The Vivo V40 Pro,so today we got the new v40 and v40 Pro from Vivo and these are co-engineered with Zeiss so there is a huge focus on camera but these are also apparently in the V series here the thinnest devices packing 5500 mAh battery so I'm really interested in checking out just how slim these are considering there's still a large battery inside this is the standard v40 this is the v40 pro difference in box Siz is kind of interesting let's start with the v40 now these are obviously going to be be available in a couple of different colors I have purple I like that just straight up simple purple and it's got 12 gigs of RAM 512 storage you're getting a Snapdragon chip in the v40 whereas you go to a mediatech in the v40 Pro well that's nice purple phone purple case included in the package C to a cable the device and I'm guessing the reason we have the bigger package on the v40 pro is because we're probably going to have a charger in there now both of these devices are capable of recharging at 801 Watts now this is our first Glimpse at the Zeiss co-branding the partnership also we have something here AAL light Optical image stabilized portrait that's an interesting looking flash area USBC SIM tray power switch volume rocker and a unique camera layout the device is extremely thin for something that's packing 5500 mAh battery okay moving on to the v40 pro identically slim but that's pretty cool even though you go to the pro model the camera area you can see is laid out slightly different ring light is below the added camera here and inside the pro package we're also going to get a case this time in Black same USBC to a cable and then the beefy charger this is Flash charge 80 W Max and either of these two devices will take advantage of all 80 WTS ooh dirt bike so here we can see the screen resolution 2400x 1080 and and our screen refresh is set to Smart Switch to move between fast and slow in order to maintain your battery life however you can lock it at 60 or lock it at 120 and the screen is actually higher resolution than 2400x 1080 but it's going to save power if you use it in that mode you can also run it at its full resolution 2800x 1260 all right let's do some standard photos we have our favorite prop Ultra wide is quite wide represented as 6 but if I tap on it you can see it's also got the focal length representation of 15 mil 1X or 23 mil 2X or 50 mil and 4x or 100 Mil you can see the camera versatility you get from Ultra wide all the way up to 100 Mil now for video we can shoot up to 4K 60 frames uh I'll be the judge of how entertaining MO is so this is our 4K 60 frame uh Mo camera test that we are very familiar with and we like to evaluate the detail actually tremendous detail I can see Little Fibers and stuff on your hat oh really because it's black yeah like you know like typical Little Fibers how hairs though gray hairs oh yeah I got them I got a couple of Grays in there audio testing one oh and let's also test the audio while we're at it this is officially an audio test emo that wasn't so bad was it I could have done you worse either you're getting nicer or I could have done you worse I thought it through it crossed my mind so there's a couple of different portrait modes that Zeiss wants to highlight here the first is called multifocal portrait then there's style portrait and then lastly AA light portrait with 3D Studio lighting utilizing this section here of the camera now there's also portrait that moves into video they have something called cinematic portrait which works as expected aiming to behave like portrait mode in Stills but instead carry that over to video so Studio portrait uses a lot of these features in one it's got the Zeiss portrait lens kit the boka flare the beauty mode all with one tap so you get this kind of Studio effect and you can see the different focal lengths are represented like you would have on an actual traditional camera 100 being a very popular choice for portraits you can go in and select different bokeh settings which is pretty wild and these different bokeh settings mimic popular Zeiss glass biotar bped a planar distagon cine flare and cinematic so if you want your bokeh balls to have a slightly different shape you can create that you can also increase or decrease that effect now they have some presets that they're calling portrait lens kit this will aim to mimic very popular portrait lens Combos and choices let's try 100 Mil closeup on Mo are you ready oh you look very beautiful you've been beautified look at your complexion just beyond perfect superhuman complexion you can see the specs of this particular photo 100 Mil F4 150th shutter ISO 145 now what's cool is you can actually refocus it as well so if you want to change your settings after the fact you just click on the boka button and then go in there and make your adjustments monitor Mo camera Mo watch monitor Mo and then the amount of bokeh right here boom now I'm going to try it again but this next time what I'm going to do is turn off the beauty mode and just use the remainder of the portrait effects and mo is going to have a little bit more you tell me you want background I'm going to try an 85 you stay where you are you stay right there Mo all right so this is kind of a complicated task you see his hat is like meshing with the ceiling there you've got some detail in the foreground he's obviously the focal point and you can see the fall off over here to the side like where his shirt is background foreground background foreground right on the eye done without the beauty mode turned on you get a a more natural complexion you can see a little bit more detail in his face and obviously the imperfections like if you want the full Studio portrait effect look at this guy look at that guy it's it's a lot there's a lot to it if I switch to 24 you can see that resets 35 100 boom depending on the focal length that I select that will change the spread of the light whether I need a Slimmer beam to travel further or if I want to diffuse that light and have a wider spread both the v40 and v40 pro come with this upgraded Aura light and this is 33% brighter than on the previous generation is there such a thing as a front portrait yes there is should I try beauty or no Beauty what do you think damn that is like for a selfie camera on the front of the phone are you seeing this this front-facing image looks like old rear facing images like from not that many years ago maybe I should just also while I'm here do a more intense beauty mode oh yeah see how it's smoothing me out even more I'm getting smoother as we go all right let's try this movie boka in the Cinematic mode and I'm going to make it as strong as possible cuz I'm just curious how this is going to work oh mo you are definitely cinematic man and is it cutting me out from the background you're cut out brother you are cut out is it look good you decide oh yeah you're cut out that looks really good stereo speaker speaker one speaker [Music] two charge animation check charging flash charge real time be even faster if the battery was lower Dolphins I'm in the animal kingdom vibrants so there you have it v40 and v40 pro purple and silver which is more appealing to you,so today we got the new v40 and v40 Pro from Vivo and these are co-engineered with Zeiss so there is a huge focus on camera but these are also apparently in the V series here the thinnest devices packing 5500 mAh battery so I'm really interested in checking out just how slim these are considering there's still a large battery inside this is the standard v40 this is the v40 pro difference in box,0.0,0.9996,0.7325
@unboxtherapy,Diamond,PCEmUPqSK4k,Like a Gaming Phone but HUGE,"so you guys heard about red Magic's gaming phones smartphones that are specifically tailored for maximum gaming performance but what about a tablet or what they're calling a gaming pad I've actually got two versions of it here in front of me I think this one is just a little slightly higher spec 16 gigs Ram 512 storage and then this one over here is 12x 256 they're both in the midnight color and it's called the Nova gaming tablet so I guess two different price points so you can figure out which one is more suitable for you I'm sure both of them are going to be plenty powerful so here is a tablet an interesting scale and size for gaming probably a little easier to hold for extended periods of time than if you had something enormous so we have a front-facing camera in the landscape orientation volume rocker power switch some speakers on the leand side and speakers on the right hand side so that gives you that stereo separation USB type-c some sort of logo pin style connector down here red USB C Toc cable substantial power brick stickers Apple got rid of the stickers red magic increased the number of stickers now this is going to remind you of their smartphones in the back you can see these slightly see-through glass panels Snapdragon 8 gen 3 we're going to have the latest from Snapdragon in there 50 megapixel camera and they're kind of keeping this whole like cyborg theme to it the rest of the devices this kind of of matte black finish so the power switch on the top doubles as your fingerprint scanner and it's a little bit recessed so you don't hit it by accident I believe there's going to be probably a set of accessories in order to enhance its capabilities even more so considering the fact that we have these pins and these kind of like locking sections on the bottom of the tablet it has a high-res 16 by10 display with a 144 HZ refresh rate and sampling rate up to 840 HZ the battery 10,100 mahs with an 80 w fast charger included in the Box the all metal design comes in at 530 G and they have dtsx sound with four total speakers and some vibration effects oh man jeez our fight ends here Diana it's running red magic OS 9.0 which is of course built on top of Android with of course some gaming enhancements and to remind you that it's red magic and gaming it has RGB lighting there's somebody there give me the loot is this a hovercraft that is the greatest vehicle ever just hovercraft water land no okay it's play long range anyway man I got hit pretty good that's the best I got hit yet oh no D I want to use some first aid I didn't pick up any ammo for this oh damn it going back to the long range where is that up high did you see those shots no scope whatever you guys suck oh we got like a big vest on I'm better without the scope I don't even need the scope man I'm just drinking sports drinks end game three people left well that was inevitable that was inevitable yeah Champion pretty obvious those were Bots man they couldn't fight couldn't fight at all those were not real you play you know how many hits I was going to have to take to die like I'm just drinking sports [Music] drinks speakers are good on that one whoa this game is sick though I like this game and the sound I really appreciate the sound now after playing this game what do we have is this fan making like any noise right now is it even getting very hot no I can't I can't even hear anything you've been playing for about an hour now was I playing for an hour obviously a very capable gaming tablet here I can play for like an hour and it's not too hot to hold it's kind of the right form factor for a lot of games too like it's not too big where you're going to get extremely fatigued holding it this has also got a fully functioning USBC Port capable of connecting peripherals if you want to have it propped up with these eventual accessories you could uh connect a keyboard and mouse and game with it that way you could also output the video signal to a larger screen if you want to use it as your primary Computing device they have a cooling system that features a 20,000 RPM fan a 3D heat pipe and internal circulation air duct yes even though it's a tablet it does have cameras 20 maps on the front 50 maps on the rear probably front facing could be for a video conferencing we have some rear facing here's a little sample of that they'll work for you it is not the primary emphasis on a gaming tablet and we have a couple of different options at different price points depending on if you want to max out that RAM and storage capacity at the time that I'm filming this I don't even have the retail price for this yet but it's it's a fast refresh loud speakers multimedia kind of EXP experience from a company that in the smartphone space has already given you plenty of gaming options and now they're doing the same thing in the tablet space with what they're calling the gaming pad and they managed to squeeze RGB in there so you would never forget listen to this Banger this music you kidding [Music] [Music] suspense oh W you land on top [Music] what I don't even know what that was that was I supposed to do I no I was supposed to do [Music] that oh no I didn't even see that",so you guys heard about red Magic's gaming phones smartphones that are

@Dave2D,Gold,b4x8boB2KdI,M4 MacBook Pro Review - Things to Know,so Apple launched the new M4 MacBook Pros this is their 14-in model and it's equipped with the M4 Max their topend configuration and it also has their new Nano texture on their screen it's a texture that's designed to cut down Reflections it's the first time they've actually had it on one of their laptops uh but I want to do a quick video here that kind of goes over the important things I think you should be aware of when it comes to this device and the first thing I want to talk about is performance the CPU gains are quite good year on-ear but it's particularly impressive that the M4 Max can outperform the M2 Ultra in a lot of benchmarks and workflows in terms of Graphics the GPU gains on the M4 Pro are decent but the GPU games on the M4 Max are very impressive most GPU bound apps and games will get a nice bump up from this plus the rate tracing capabilities are better so apps and games can take advantage of that the thing I'm most impressed by though is how good the M4 Max GPU is compared to the previous generation especially at a very similar thermal envelope like if you think about the competitors in this space like AMD Nvidia when they come out with laptop gpus typically the new models come also come with like an increase in power requirement right it's just like you know 5 or 10 watts per year but it adds up over the course of time and on this device if you think about the M1 Max to the M4 Max the GPU has improved so much with very little increase in power consumption The Thermals on this device are pretty much the same as last year's models in terms of memory the base configuration start at 16 GB now thankfully and they've also increased the memory bandwidth it's noticeable already on the base models but the pro and Max chips get a significant boost in memory speed so for applications that lean on Fast memory you definitely notice a bump up this year if I'm being honest though it's difficult for me to tell how much of the gains that we're seeing this year come from the memory speed increase versus the CPU or the GPU increase like they're all tied together and I don't have the tools to lock memory speed on a Macbook so it's tough to tell I will say though that if you have an older M1 or M2 or M3 MacBook Pro I wouldn't upgrade because Apple's silicon performance progresses so fast year on-ear that it can pay off to just wait as long as you can before you buy new hardware okay let's talk about the screens so this particular device is running their new Nano texture finish and it's finish we've seen on other devices before right like their screens uh the new iPads and every time I've ever talked about that texture in a video like a review video I've been like it's nice but it's not all that special at least not to me but check this out so on the laptop the one on the left that is the Nano texture this is a regular uh like the glossy finish and I have an overhead light do you see the difference in the reflection it's not just like a diffusion it's a pretty distinct reduction in just light emittance and I think okay when it came to the regular screens and the iPad I even said this in my review of that like it's a nice it's a nice feature for some people but for me I would never get it but for whatever reason on the laptop I looked at this I'm like this is awesome I totally would get this if I was buying this year's device and I think it's because on a laptop your face tends to be a little bit closer to the screen because we're just like you know that's how we use a laptops versus a desktop you tend to be a little bit further away from the screen and because it's a little bit closer I just find that the reflections that are being muted by this finish are like it just seems to have more impact there's just more value to that feature So it's 15 option and it's also not like a coating or some kind of layer that they put on top it's part of the glass it's like a a treatment for the glass they etch it with some kind of acid and it just does this to the glass and supposedly it doesn't affect the durability or like fragility of it but we'll have to see the other new feature for the screens this year is that they now get brighter these now are able to hit a thousand nits at the top end but in order to get it you have to be in a really bright environment for that detector to be like okay you need that extra brightness it's a nice feature ad but I wouldn't be buying a new device just for that brighter screen and also there's apps like better display that crank up the brightness of your screen like beyond the stock levels if that's something that you really need uh okay ports so the number of USBC ports has increased on the baseall from two to three so last year's M3 MacBook Pro at the base only had these two USBC ports on the left and then on the right there was no third USBC Port but now all of the MacBook Pros the M4 devices all have three USBC ports now now on the base M4 it is still just Thunderbolt 4 and then on the M4 Pro and M4 Max chips they're Thunderbolt 5 now I've said this some previous videos but Thunderbolt 5 is not particularly useful for most people in terms of like having faster storage because Thunderbolt 3 and4 are plenty fast for that but Thunderbolt 5 enables higher resolution displays because of that extra bandwidth if that's important to you the battery life is supposed to be longer lasting this generation the battery size stays the same but for my testing I didn't see too much of a gain with heavy workflows on the 14-in model but for lighter tasks it was definitely a little bit longer lasting the webcam has improved over the previous generation the M4 MacBook Pros are now running a 12 megapixel sensor and this because of the higher resolution enables Center Stage so as you move around it'll kind of track your face and do the stuff we've seen on like iPads and iMacs it's a neat feature and I do think that the image quality is better but it's very slight like this is still a very thin panel on the screen so you can't put like huge sens or huge Optics in that uh webcam area Okay uh the other thing that's changed for this year is they've gotten rid of the space gray coloration which is I think a huge shame this is the space black it's not like a new color but they don't have space gray anymore it's the only dark colored MacBook Pro they have uh but otherwise it's a nice bump I think the performance this year is much more impressive than I thought it would be particularly on the GPU component uh but yeah there you have it that's the new M4 Max MacBook Pros,so Apple launched the new M4 MacBook Pros this is their 14-in model and it's equipped with the M4 Max their topend configuration and it also has their new Nano texture on their screen it's a texture that's designed to cut down Reflections it's the first time they've actually had it on one of their laptops uh but I want to do a quick video here that kind of goes over the important things I,0.0,0.9998,0.3589
@Dave2D,Gold,qExcc92zHfo,M4 Mac Mini Review - Apple NAILED It.,so this is the new M4 equipped Mac Mini and it's something special first of all it's very small if you compare the size to uh the previous generation of Mac Mini it's like a much smaller footprint but then when you compare it to the current generation of Mac Studio it's like it looks like a completely different class of product but you'll see in a minute the benchmarks and performance of this thing can many cases keep up with the Mac Studio so I bring up the conversation of size at the start of of this video because there is nothing else on the market that is of this size that has this kind of performance and also is priced as well as this thing is so this thing starts at $600 retail $500 for students and I'd argue that it's one of the best valued products that Apple has ever put out at least for the base model now a couple thoughts about the design the power button is located on the bottom and when I first saw that I was like that's kind of weird but having used this for a week it's such a light and small device that just to like tilt it up and hit it it's effortless like you won't accidentally press it or anything like that and how often are you actually turning on this on and off this machine it's like very easy to do it even one-handed uh the other thing is if you'll notice on the bottom there's a circular Grill here so this serves as an intake and the exhaust so typically on the Mac desktops there's like a rear mounted exhaust that kind of sucks cool air in and then out the back but because it's such a small device there's no rear exhaust it's just it sucks the cooler in goes through the device then comes out the back portion of this circular exhaust and it's just a neat way for them to cool a device that's super small because they just didn't have the capability to put an exhaust on the back like they typically would on the larger desktops uh the other thing is the built-in speaker is significantly better than the one that was on the previous generation of Mac minis it's still not a great sounding sound system it's just that for people that want that super clean setup with no like speakers on their desk uh you can do that on this I think they're good enough and loud enough for that if you want want that speakerless setup but also there is no mic so if you want to have like voice calls and stuff you need to have a webcam or some kind of audio input device for your Communications now in regards to Ports there are three Thunderbolt ports on the back they're either going to be Thunderbolt 4 or Thunderbolt 5 depending on the chip that you go with in terms of configurations and on the front there's also two more USBC ports these are not Thunderbolt enabled but if you'll notice there are no usba a ports at all on this device and if you plan on connecting a keyboard to this thing like a wired keyboard there are a lot of keyboards out there that still do not support like a direct USBC to USBC connection you might need some kind of dongle to make it work now Apple's own peripherals have been updated they now support USBC charging so instead of the lightning charging hole it now supports like a regular USBC connection the mouse the Magic Mouse has also been updated to USBC but it's still on the bottom like this came out in 2015 I want to say it's been like a decade of memes of upside down charging memes on this thing they didn't care they're like yeah here is the new one more upside down charging so the Macon itself this comes in either the M4 chip or the M4 Pro chip the pro gives you more CPU and GPU cores it also has more RAM and storage at the base and also at the top end but the M4 Pro chip also gets you Thunderbolt 5 ports now Thunderbolt 5 ports are significantly higher bandwidth than Thunderbolt 3 and four of the past but the reality is that there's not a lot of utility to Thunderbolt 5 outside of displays like if you're trying to connect super fast drives Thunderbolt 3 and four are more than enough for it if you want to connect ultra high resolution displays three of them to this machine then yeah the Thunderbolt 5 connection would be useful just the base model though already has really good connectivity for external displays you get three of them so the M4 and M4 Pro chips are incredibly fast these chips perform really well on benchmarks and workflows that lean on really fast C performance the multi-core performance of the m M4 Pro is particularly impressive to me now in terms of GPU performance the M4 chips are a decent step up over the M2 chips from a couple years back but depending on your workflow these new chips can be very impressive so the way that I shoot my videos that I have four 4K cameras running simultaneously so I have one in the back there and then I have one over here and then I have two in front depending on the camera angle that I want to use I'll switch them in real time using the uh stream deck and I'll just swap them depending on what I want to show you what I want you guys to look at at a particular moment I do this stuff during my shoot like I don't I try not to edit so much later on I try to do this stuff at the moment just so it feels a little bit more live for you guys now in order to pull this off this needs a fairly powerful system because this has four 4k camera feeds being encoded at real time at once and to do this I have an M2 Ultra system I used to use uh like a regular Windows system RTX 490 but that thing was very loud because you're running this thing the whole time of the shoot and if you'll notice it's quiet I couldn't do that with any window system that I built but this GPU or the the GPU cores that are inside the system are being pushed pretty hard I wouldn't say that's like full but that's probably you know 60 70% of the GPU usage and this whole thing works the only reason why it works is because that M2 Ultra is as powerful and as quiet as it is so the Mac Studio handles my workflow very well but how does the new M4 Mac Mini do this is the same camera setup so it's four 4K cameras being fed into the system but it's being run off of the M4 Pro Mac Mini and you can tell the GPU pressure is pretty high right it's going full blast and the 14 CPU cores are ripping but it keeps up and this is all real time like it's being recorded and encoded off of that device now when I first set this up I tried to use the M2 Pro Pro Mac Mini to tie everything together and it wasn't even close this thing was dropping frames like crazy and I think it was just the it's just a very demanding workflow when you have realtime encoding of multiple cameras it's tough especially if you want to do it quietly so when the M4 Mac Mini showed up I was like I wanted it to work so badly cuz this is so small and compact it'd be such a testament to how powerful this thing really is if it could do this and it did granted the M2 Ultra Does It Better there's more Headroom on it but that thing's like four times the price and like six times the size and to do it on this system that's so crazy cool now it does get warm when it's going full blast for a long period of time but it's still very very quiet and for all intents and purposes it's pretty much a silent machine uh now quick note on gaming so I think because this thing is priced the way that it is relatively inexpensively and because it's as powerful as it is at that price point I've already seen a lot of kind of Articles and Publications clickbait around the idea of like you know the Mac Mini is the is a p is five killer it is not so yes it does have inexpensive Hardware like a console and it does have very powerful capabilities kind of like a console way more powerful than a console but it does not have the library of games that makes a gaming machine so like if you want to install crossover and play with wine and tweak all that stuff or do like a Windows installation or a windows partition you can it's just that I think there's just no it's not a gaming device it's gaming capable and every that goes by it's even more capable but we're so far away from being able to call this a gaming device that's just my take on it okay I want to move this conversation to what I think is the most important thing the pricing and the configuration so at the base price it's a very good deal but any kind of upgrade any kind of tweak to this configuration at the base massively increases its price and I just have thoughts about that this unit here that did most of my testing on is the M4 Pro chip it's the one that they sent out for reviewers to kind of give the best impression of what the M4 Mac Mini is capable of however I think the vast majority of people should never even look at the pro chip because the base M4 is already very capable and unless you know that your workflow demands some kind of very powerful CPU and or GPU I would not even look at that Pro pricing just because you get amazing value at that base chip now in terms of the RAM and storage the ram is horrifically overpriced the moment you start adding stuff it's $200 for an extra 8 gigs of RAM and then $400 for an extra 16 gigs of ram it's painful just looking at those numbers on their website now I did think that when I was looking at these things I thought we should all be really thankful that Apple intelligence came to life like if Apple intelligence didn't come out then Apple wouldn't feel the need to have 16 GB models on their base model and we might still just be looking at 8 gigs of RAM on this on this machine like for real that in an alternate universe that could actually have been the case uh but so yeah Ram I wouldn't I wouldn't spring for more unless you have a very clear clear need in your mind of like particular workflows that need it I wouldn't even say most video editing would need it if you're kind of like mid moderate levels of uh video editing the other thing is storage and the storage is equally painful to look at I think most people at this point recognize that you can get external options and I think on a system like this you're not carrying it around it's just makes much more sense to have an external drive there are two kinds of externals I want to talk about there's the regular fast USB drives that are relatively inexpensive but then there's the ultra fast USB for Thunderbolt type drives and these are crazy fast they're still not as fast as the internal storage of the Mac Mini but if you need really fast St if you're working with like really large media files and you need to process it and just ingest it quickly on these systems uh I would highly recommend like a use or Thunderbolt type Drive instead of the regular USB 3.2 or slower drives in case you're unfamiliar with those things uh last thing the chip for the people that are trying to decide like should I get the the pro or the non-pro the pro it's like probably three $400 more just for the chip itself you do get more RAM and storage but if you're unsure and you're like not you know immediately aware of that you need to get the pro I would just get the regular one and also think that if you want to resell the stuff later on like let's say you do get the regular like base M4 and you find out a year later oh you know I want something faster it is I think it' be very easy to sell off a base M4 for close to what you paid it for that's just what I think okay uh there there you have it that's the M4 and M4 Pro Mac Mini really awesome system this year,so this is the new M4 equipped Mac Mini and it's something special first of all it's very small if you compare the size to uh the previous generation of Mac Mini it's like a much smaller footprint but then when you compare it to the current generation of Mac Studio it's like it looks like a completely different class of product but you'll see in a minute the benchmarks and performance of this thing,0.0,0.9998,0.8442
@Dave2D,Gold,1rJa-0YOkwk,"The Tiny Apple ""Phone""",a few months ago this product was announced out of nowhere it's called the tiny pod and it's a gadget that transforms your Apple watch into this iPod looking thing but it also has a scroll wheel and the marketing around this thing is very interesting it kind of hits on the whole Nostalgia and like Simplicity of a device like this but because the core of this product is an Apple Watch it has a lot of modern kind of smartphone functionality you can stream and download music on this thing you can check your messages you can use it for maps your email basically every app that exists on an Apple Watch you have access to but most importantly you have access to a phone because if your Apple watch has an LTE signal you have a phone and this tiny machine this tiny pod can suddenly be used as a tiny phone and in theory could replace an iPhone now the Nostalgia Factor on this thing was very high when I saw all this marketing I was like that is so cool if this thing's like 100 bucks or less I want to try it it turns out it's $7 $9 now I was sent an early production sample last week and it comes in a very simple packaging it's kind of like it's got some apple Vibes going on but when you pop it open the first thing I noticed was that there's like a very thin layer of grease on this whole thing it didn't make sense at first but you'll understand why in a second but the other thing I noticed right out of the box was that this thing does not look nearly as nice in real life as it did in the renders like when I looked on the website I was looking around like everything looks so perfect on that site and also the kind of plastic imperfections are not visible on the renders but here it just it almost feels like a child's toy like almost like a burner toy for kids like if Fisher Price made a burner phone for kids like this is what it would look like uh but I got it in and I'm like hey I got to check this thing out now this particular unit houses uh well the the the Apple watch I'm putting here is an Apple Watch se but they make different sizes depending on the Apple watch that you want to throw in but the first thing I checked out was the scroll wheel and it works but it's not great it's not this smooth and effortless scroll wheel like you might expect or might hope it's very inconsistent now on this particular unit I've even stuffed a piece of paper at the top of my Apple watch just to be able to make sure that it's got a very snug fit because this whole Contraption needs to have very tight fitting parts to be able to make it go um so it fits perfectly is just that the mechanism is not perfect now let me show you how this whole thing works cuz it is interesting the way they've done it if you think about it an Apple Watch is typically controlled by the crown so how do you transfer the rotational energy of your scroll movements to turning the Apple watch so they have this neat mechanism that's entirely mechanical there's no like Wireless uh stuff there's no electronics on the inside it's just a mechanical system and kind of cool so normally has screws I removed those previously but this is is the scroll wheel and as you spin it around it has a series of pulleys that in turn activates the crown of the Apple watch which would sit inside like so and as you rotate your scroll wheel and it turns the pulley it turns the crown it's a neat mechanism but if you're wondering why all that lube was sitting all over this is a mechanical thing that needs to be well lubricated in order to move properly and I think that's why there was like excess grease when I opened this thing up but it is neat as to how they were able to engineer scroll wheel to work with an Apple watch now the next thing you might think is like okay they solved that but how did they solve the click like the button how did they solve you know getting into the things that you've selected let me tell you it turns out they didn't so there's no way to select the things that you've selected using the scroll wheel area you have to touch and or tap the screen and the moment I realized this I was like this just falls apart for me like the moment you're touching the screen then the whole scroll wheel functionality falls apart and then the whole Nostalgia element of this thing falls apart because half of what makes a good scroll wheel is the mechanism of like selecting things like this is uh first generation iPod Nano super old but look at this thing like super precise right but if you want to click on something it's just like you're in right and it's like it's got this tactile feel to it now on the tiny pod there is a bit of like tactility as you scroll around because the haptics of the appple watch are clicking in but there's this is not functional I'm like what is this and I look on the website and it's not very clear that this is not a button or anything you have to tap on the screen and the moment you're doing that I don't know it almost feels like a Teemu version of what this product could have been if it worked the way that we would expect it to like if the scroll wheel worked really well flawlessly like nicely machine and everything was tight and effortless and consistent and also if the button worked like that that would be really neat but in its current state it just feels it feels like a toy that doesn't work the way that we want it to if I'm being completely honest but there is a cheaper version of this that doesn't have the scroll with they have a $30 version that's just like a case for the form factor and I will say that if you hold this device it's easier to hold and manipulate it than it would be if you're just using the like the Apple watch by itself without any straps if you're trying to use like you know I mean if this is the tiny pod this is the tiniest pod right there's no and it's it's but this is this doesn't feel comfortable in your hands if you're using it so I don't want to knock on the company I think it's really cool when companies try cool stuff like this it's interesting the idea of it not going to lie it's awesome it's just that it's not implemented in a way that I think most people will enjoy especially if you came at this thing they hope that would be like this nostalgic experience for the Apple watch all right hope you guys enjoyed this video,a few months ago this product was announced out of nowhere it's called the tiny pod and it's a gadget that transforms your Apple watch into this iPod looking thing but it also has a scroll wheel and the

@Dave2D,Gold,tYJWcs-qnAc,"My iPhone 16 / Pro / Max ""Review""",I was conflicted as to whether or not I should even review these phones because these phones are incomplete out of the gate the iPhone 16 devices are missing what many would argue to be the most important feature Apple intelligence it's even the thing that Apple says these phones were built for a new generation of iPhone built from the ground up to deliver Apple intelligence and its breakthrough capabilities you can't properly test out the full Apple intelligence experience so feel strange to review it but these phones are going to be available in the stores in a couple days I thought I would do a review based on what you do get just keep in mind that a lot of the features of what these phones are supposed to do come in the future okay when you unbox the phones this year the classic Apple stickers are no longer around it's just paper pamphlets and then the charging cables are coiled up into ovals instead of the circles from before they're the same length of cable they're just wound up differently now the colors on the regular non-pro models are very vibrant this year they just pop and if you think about last year when they first came up with that way to deposit colors into glass and just do that subtle pastel stuff they just took it to 11 and you get these very colorful phones this year and I was a little bit disappointed that I got the ultramarine blue instead of the teal for the review unit like not that it matters I have to send these things back anyways but I just I just wanted the teal I was hoping I would get it they didn't send it to me uh the pro devices no colorful options this year the closest to a color is this thing the desert titanium it's a nice color I get it this is a very in color too right now in terms of like fashionable colors but I don't know it's just strange to me that the pro devices didn't get any kind of vibrant colors this year they usually do so these are the four new phones this year we have the iPhone 16 the 16 plus the 16 Pro and then the 16 Pro Max and all four of them have the action button this year only the Pro Models had them last year but now they're on the top left and all of them have it so the regular iPhone 16s no longer have the hardware toggle which is I think a lot of people are going to miss and then on the right side of each phone or like the right edge of each phone there is now the new button which is called camera control they don't like calling it a button but it is a button because you can press down on it and it depresses like a button but we'll come back to the camera control in a minute uh the screens on the iPhone 16 and 16 plus haven't changed from the previous generation so these still have a 6.1 and 6.7 in display respectively they're very nice screens in terms of image quality for regular media but they're still 60 HZ panels and when you use them just swiping around they if you're used to high refresh panels these feel strangely sluggish for a 2024 device especially one that cost $800 and $900 respectively I hope I really hope that this is the last year that Apple does this at least that's the rumor now the screens on the pro devices are bigger these are now 6.3 and 6.9 in now if I'm being honest I really think most people would have a tough time telling these new screens apart from the previous generation from the iPhone 15 Pro devices the only real way to tell is by looking at the bezel so this is a 15 Pro Max and the older device has a noticeably thicker bezel but again you just really have to be looking for it now one thing I did notice about the 16 Pro Max uh and also the 16 Pro but it's more prominent on the pro Max I remember last year talking about how in certain games the inner parts of my palm would touch the screen like the edges of the screen and would cause some accidental inputs it is even more pronounced on the 16 Pro Max I think the bezel is just like so thin that it's very easy for an accidental input on stuff like this so I think a case fixes it but if you are someone that goes caseless for whatever reason you're just clicking things by accident sometimes that's just the nature of very thin bezels and keep in mind this is only for games when you're like actually gripping it tight like this watching shows and stuff not an issue the ceramic shield glass on the new iones are supposed to be 50% stronger than the previous generation but if you do want a screen protector the new ones from dbrand are really good and they're super easy to put on the regular iPhone 16s are pretty much the same size as the previous generation but the pro devices are bigger because they have slightly bigger screens but it's so slight like this is the 15 Pro Max versus 16 Pro Max you can barely tell the difference both visually and in your hand uh okay let's talk about performance so as you would expect new phones new chips better performance the Pro Models have a new thermal substructure which is supposed to help with heat for sustained performance I didn't really notice a big Improvement when I was testing for it with my regular genjin impact test iPhones especially the Pro Models have typically been really good for thermal dissipation amongst all phones but from all the testing I've done on these they're all very fast and the regular iPhone 16s get a big fat GPU boost over the previous generation it's a really nice upgrade for the regular 16s this year they're using larger batteries this time and from my light testing like light load testing it is crazy how long the iPhone 16 Pro Max lasts it's kind of strange I really think it's just to be able to support the energy use of Apple intelligence especially for stuff like on device image generation uh so the wired and wireless charging speeds are quite fast this year if you have the right Chargers to pull it off you can get some higher wattage into these devices uh okay let's talk about that camera control button thing uh let's start off with this blue one okay wrong side again camera control so this is a capacitive pressure sensitive button type thing now one of the main purposes of this button is to launch a upcoming feature called visual intelligence it's a part of Apple intelligence and it's designed toble to you know you press this button and it'll give you basically Google Lens functionality you can point the camera at something and it'll give you information as well as some kind of AI assisted feedback as to what the thing is that you're looking at now because it's not available yet there's no point even talking about it but the other thing that this button is supposed to be able to do is camera control and that's kind of like the main name that they're giving it right now camera control so at the basic level you press it and it opens the camera app you press it again you take a picture if you press and hold it it starts rolling video now the basic functionality is awesome I think that you know with one hand you can pick up your phone take pictures take videos without repositioning your hand one-handed it's awesome but there's way more to it so Apple has built an entire UI around that button inside the camera app and you navigate around this interface using this camera control button thing now my initial impression when I used it at their demo was that it was a little confusing to use and I thought the interface even though simple was difficult to navigate with all these different inputs like sliding and tapping with varying pressure but after using for a week I would say that the interaction itself is very intuitive it's just that the interface and the idea of controlling your camera like this I'm not sure if it's something most people would actually want to use like when you navigate around you still have to use two hands this is not a one-handed operation launching it and just taking the picture yeah you can do that with one hand on that button but if you want to actually navigate around and slide around with your finger you definitely need two hands and I don't know if it's any faster or more convenient than just using the on screen buttons it does also work in the vertical orientation but I just just found this to be an uncomfortable grip I don't think people typically hold their phone this far down the sides so it's like this weird claw grip you kind of have to go two hands again in vertical mode now there are some features that I do think that using the sliding mechanism is better so there's two that come to mind the first is like Zoom because when you use pinch to zoom it can kind of be fairly inaccurate to kind of like nail it just right but with that slide mechanism you can kind of you know you slide around and you get a good feel of how much you need to move your finger the other menu that I think works well with camera control is their new photographic Styles menu so this is kind of like algorithmic processing of your shots that you take it's non-destructive and you can play with it but the reason why it works so well with the camera control interface is because there's so many to choose from there's five skin undertones and then there's like nine photo tones and you get 14 to flip through and if you're just using the on screen controls there's like a lot of flicking and swiping but with this it's just you're sliding around it's like a care cell just choosing the style that you want and you can f tune each one to your preferences but I don't know how often I would personally use a feature like that I played with it and I just could not imagine a scenario when I was just regularly using this thing to be able to take pictures a certain way but I'm really lazy with my photos I'm just like very much point and shoot so I would say that for the average person if you're just if the way that you've used your camera for most of your life is just point and shoot I don't think the camera control interface like this whole thing is all that useful if it's it really feels like it's geared for people that like to manually tweak their shots and then it makes you think how many people really do that and then if it's not a lot of people why is it on all of the devices like even the non-pro versions of these phones like the regular iPhone 16s they have this camera control as well my gut feeling is that this button thing will be used mostly for just launching the camera app taking photos and videos and uh Apple's visual intelligence when it comes around okay the camera system so the iPhone 16 have what they're now calling a 48 mapel Fusion camera now it seems to be the same Hardware as the iPhone 15 the images do look better on the 16 if you look closely especially when you use that 2x telephoto but it's subtle differences you really need to look for them the ultrawide cameras have also been updated on the 16s as well these now have a new 12 megapixel sensor that can shoot macro photos as well it is noticeably better in low light photos compared to the 15 from last year but it's still not as good as the competition I think like Samsung and Google have really good low light Ultra wide cameras in their normal tier phones the pro phones also have an updated 48 megap Ultra wide this is a noticeable step up from the previous generation like the low light in particular looks quite a bit cleaner uh the main shooter has also been labeled as a new 48 megapixel Fusion camera it's supposed to be a faster sensor but from the shots I was taking I couldn't really tell much of a difference between the new 16 Pro Max and the 15 Pro Max from previous generation that new sensor though does allow for 4K 120 shot from that sensor the mics on all the new iPhone 16s have a neat feature where when you use the phone for video recordings you can then go to the camera app in post and you can adjust and clean up the audio from the capture check this out so I have some pretty loud environmental noise going on it's coming from a YouTube video that's off that's on but I'm talking at a pretty normal talking volume I'm not talking super loud or anything but you'll see how good this app is at removing that sound we've seen third party apps and tools like this before but to see it built into the phone and have like the mics send the spatial data to be able to calculate it better it's just neat I think they've done a really good job of just taking advantage of the different mics on these devices okay real quickly let's talk about AI so all four phones this year have 8 gigs of RAM and they also have the same kind of apple intelligence capabilities well they will when Apple intelligence fully Launches on these devices but all of the currently available Apple intelligence features are in beta still and they're the same few features that we've been testing on the iPhone 15 Pro devices so it's like asking Siri to summarize something or to ask it some like Loosely contextual questions or having it to clean up the photos they're neat but the more interesting and arguably more useful features like having some kind of context aware Siri or the chat GPT integration or having the image generation those things are months away some of them coming out next year and it's weird to me how so many Apple intelligence features are really far away in terms of a timeline and it's also really weird to me how Apple marketed this whole thing like this is a phone that's available today it's available to be purchased two days from now and it was supposed to be designed and built from the ground up for Apple intelligence yet we can't test the vast majority of Apple Intelligence on these things like it could be amazing in the very distant future but like I'm not saying they should rush it I'm not sure they should release it now but I'm just saying they shouldn't have marketed these phones as these AI or apple intelligence phones when it's missing so much of the equation right now if I'm being honest I think the pro phones will have a tough time selling this year there just isn't enough of a kind of feature differentiator to pull people to it I don't think uh the regular 16s they seem pretty good but yeah that's my take on the new iPhone 16s,I was conflicted as to whether or not I should even review these phones because these phones are incomplete out of the gate the iPhone 16 devices are missing what many would argue to be the most important feature Apple intelligence it's even the thing that Apple says these phones were built for a new generation of iPhone built from the ground up to deliver Apple intelligence and its breakthrough capabilities you can't properly test,0.0,0.9999,0.5709
@Dave2D,Gold,1OHZTFseggA,Apple Watch Series 10 + NEW Ultra Review,let's talk about the new Apple watches so we have the Apple Watch series 10 and Ultra 2 in the New Black colorway now series 10 at the launch announcement seemed like this very mild iterative change and I think it's because they use the term all new design like when they announce the thing they're like series 10 with its all new design and when you use that term there's this expectation that it's a wildly allnew design but this doesn't look like an all new design does it and it's because they weren't referring so much to the Aesthetics but more about how the design has a lot of new functional features so the big thing that they're touting is the bigger screen which was a little misleading in the marketing material because when they say it's 30% bigger they were comparing it to series 4 5 and 6 so if you do compare to older watches like Series 2 and three it is way bigger on series 10 and series 456 yeah it's 30% bigger but against Series 7 eight and n it is bigger they're able to squeeze an extra line of text in there but visually it's quite insignificant but also when they say that it's a larger screen than the one on watch Ultra I sure it is technically but again very slight now if you look at the pictures the bezel on series 10 does actually look a little bit thicker than the one on Series 7 8 and9 and it is but it's more it's kind of like an optical illusion because they've just removed some of the metal frame material and they've just added extra glass so yeah there is a larger bezel but it would have been metal frame frame material anyways in addition to having a larger display series 10 is supposed to use a new type of OLED Tech called a wide angled OLED that's supposed to give you better viewing angles when you view these displays off axis so if you're kind of glancing down your watch you're supposed to be able to see it better now series 10 is supposed to give a 40% brighter display than series 9 when it's viewed off AIS but for me I don't see that much of a difference now both of these are set to the lowest brightness and when I tilt it before they turn off uh I mean the difference is there but it's slight very slight to me I'm not seeing 40% now I do think it's more noticeable on certain watch faces and it does improve the overall Energy Efficiency of the screen now there's another feature on series 10 that's interesting on the display so typically on all the aods before the always on displays it would always refresh at the maximum of once per minute so you could never have a secondhand showing on your aod but with the new display it does have a visible secondhand on certain watch faces so only have two right now this one's called flux uh but you can see like the second hand ticking and I'll show you a different one I think the other one's called Reflections that's it and again uh even in aod mode you can see a secondhand timer now I personally I love this like if you're cooking or something you don't have to keep like twisting your your wrist to kind of keep track of seconds which I do pretty frequently but it's a little bit strange that it only works right now with two of the watch faces and it seems like it's like the really simple ones the ones with no other complications cuz all the other ones that I've tried uh all the other complications that have like a secondhand timer if I go into aod mode the secondhand timer disappears I just there and I mean it's nice that this Tech is there now but I feel like they're going to have to redesign a ton of the uh watch faces to take advantage of this it is only ailable on series 10 right now not even the Apple watch Ultra 2 gets it there's another feature that's unique to series 10 and it's the ability to play music on the built-in speaker temperary expectations it's a watch but this is what it sounds like the watch also has a new depth sensor and temperature sensor it measures up to 6 M deep or about 20 ft uh Apple watch Ultra 2 by comparing goes to 40 m deeper like I think 130 ft so it's much more capable on Ultra this is meant more for snorkeling but I threw it into a crude water pressure tester and it seems like the hardware just stops measuring past 22 ft like I gave it a few more pumps to simulate some extra depth but it just never recorded past 22 ft I still think it's awesome like having a depth gauge on any watch is always like such a treat even if you just go swimming you never snork you swim and you just have access to like some some deep water you just go down and just see how deep you've gone it's always fun now some thoughts about the New Dimensions this is 10% thinner around 10% thinner than the previous generations so a millimeter thinner and when they announced it during the presentation I was like who cares like no one's asking for thinner Apple watches but when you try this thing on not only is it noticeable right away like the thinness is very very obvious but it actually fits much nicer than older Apple watches and much more like a regular watch and it's because of the location of the I don't want to call them the lugs but it's like the portion that the strap connects to so on a regular watch you'd call them the lugs but because of the strap mechanism it's not quite that but they made the device thinner not just from the top like they didn't just shrink the top portion of the watch they Shrunk the bottom portion and what ends up happening is that the watch straps now come out closer to the surface of your skin and it just makes it feel much more like a typical watch that you would buy uh okay the other thing they've changed is the battery charging speed so this is now a significantly faster charging battery but it doesn't last longer it's still rated as an 18-hour battery which I think is unfortunate like they had the tech and the capability to shrink it down and instead of just packing that extra 10% of space with more battery they just made it thinner I think at this point it's safe to say that Apple like they're just shooting for a target of 18 hours I I feel like they do this on like the iPad the iPad like their targets 10 hours and I think on Apple watch their target is 18 hours and you know anything beyond that any Tech that they have access to that could extend it I don't think they go for it they just go for like a smaller package and at first I was like really bothered by this and then I thought about it and I did have this thought I tried to see from Apple's perspective which a little bit dangerous but I was like why why wouldn't they extend the battery that's the one thing that everybody would want right I did realize that like okay let's say they did extend the battery to let's say like 22 hours 24 hours right somehow this became a 24-hour battery this is still a device that would need to be charged every day like that's where it is right now it's an 18-hour battery and for most people they go through their day and they still have to throw it into the charger regardless of what they're doing the next day or how lightly they use it it's an 18- hour battery and if they extended it by another four five 6 hours it's still not enough to be like a 2-day battery so maybe that's why they just kept it at 18 it's like that sweet spot for them where they keep it thin light small but long enough enough that's my theory at least now there is a new color the regular series 10 now comes in a black anodized polished aluminum that they call jet black I'm not a fan of this color but I think it's going to be wildly popular people just love shiny black watches I get it but this is an anodized material it's not like a PVD coating it's not DLC coating it's just straight up anodization uh it's a 30 step anodization so I imagine it's better than many other anodized materials in terms of durability but it's still anodization and this will invariably chip and scratch over time it's just the nature of anodized Metals uh but it does look I guess for people that are into that nice so overall I think series 10 is a decent improvement over the previous generations I just wish they hadn't called it an allnew design because when you use that term it just paints it in a different light uh but I do think it's just like a bunch of quality of life improvements that I think a lot of people would appreciate but if you do want better battery life you're not going to get it here you got to go to Apple watch Ultra or in this case Apple watch Ultra 2 and the big change this year is a color so it comes in Black now and it's a DLC coating it's very durable one of the most durable Coatings you can get on a watch and because it uses this process to give it this color it's likely much more scratch resistant than the anodized aluminum product that we saw earlier uh but yeah this is the black Ultra Watch 2 now I much prefer the color of the kind of original natural titanium but that's just my personal preference I like the way that kind of colored straps and stuff work on the raw titanium uh okay I've never done a kind of video or review of the ultra watchat I've been wearing this for two years and just kind of a thought some some thoughts about it so the reason why I use the ultra watch is because of the long battery life I think that's the the main and possibly only draw to it uh don't really need the depth sensor as fun as it is it's just the massive battery life makes a huge difference from just my charging habits and how I use my device now the question that I often get asked by my friends and family is like has this improved your health like has the acquisition of an ultra watch or just an Apple Watch has it improved your physical health so I've been pretty consistent with using it over the past couple of years and I would confidently say that it does like I really believe that if I hadn't have used the Apple watch Ultra or just any kind of Apple watch over the past couple of years I don't feel like I would be nearly as motivated to exercise and work out and just be physically active partially it's the gamification of it all like the Rings and ever but also it's just having a bunch of friends and family that use these things and just feeling like you should work out when they do it's the stupidest thing but it's strangely powerful as a motivator uh like this is just my personal experience so if you've been on the fence after all these years years at least that's just been my experience with it uh there's one thing I want to last one last thing I want to address and I saw it pop up in the comments of my video from the September event it's the idea of will the Apple watch have any kind of like apple intelligence stuff this year and or in the future and it doesn't this year at least not the way that you would think Apple intelligence is like you can't ask it you know generative questions and stuff like that but I think that that whole capability is really far out into the future this is a very low power energy efficient device this is like very it's got a tiny battery it sips away at it over the course of the day you can't throw that type of computational power on device at least I really don't think it'll happen for quite a while okay there you have it that's my take on the new Apple watches hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time,let's talk about the new Apple watches so we have the Apple Watch series 10 and Ultra 2 in the New Black colorway now series 10 at the launch announcement seemed like this very mild iterative change and I think it's because they use the term all new design like when they announce the thing they're like series 10 with its all new design and when you use that term there's this expectation that it's,0.0,0.9999,0.7579
@MaryBautista,Gold,CHv-oKQcjF8,iPad Mini 7 Review: A MONTH LATER!,"hey guys it's your Tech girl Mary and welcome back to our YouTube channel yes this is probably your most requested video for this month and finally I'm doing it I really took my time with this one I really want to make sure I fully experience the device at the same time when I got this iPad available Apple intelligence which is why I waited for thata iPhone 16 Pro full review because of the Apple intelligence anyway to those who are wondering the iPad Mini 7 or the iPad Mini a17 Pro I got this from Beyond The Box the moment that you guys are watching this video now ongoing P pre-order nil which is from November 12 to November 18 you can pre-order the iPad Mini 7 from those dates so you can get up to 9,000 pesos off and this is only app Beyond The Box physical stores and website before we proceed with the review and the quick unboxing let's talk about pricing if you remember back in 2021 you iPad mini6 dala Lang

mag 32,990 pesos Nang and then for 256 gig SRP is 46,99 pesos and if you will pre-order magiging 39,990 Nang and lastly for the 512 gig it's 61,69 pesos and then if you pre-order magig 5299 p with those prices good thing the sponsor of today's video is home credit with home credit because of their deals as slow as 0% installment gadgets at appliances starting November 4 to January 31 of 2025 Yes you heard that right you can enjoy installments for as low as 0% interest at the same time downlo home credit app via app store or Play Store if you want to know more about the to Pasco deals of Home credit or the best way is to just click the link on my description box to download the [Music] app iPad Mini a17 Pro if you will notice with the packaging it still is the same from the iPad Mini 6 that came out last 2021 actually paging and same with the air and the pro scripture miniet unlike buying Apple tablets from other countries here in the Philippines May power brick which is the same deal from the recent iPad Air and iPad Pro which is good IP power or by the way staright and yes consist stickers USBC charging cable which is also braided and of course the power brick that I am talking about by the way protection IP gladly changes with the design the still is backwards compatible so P it's magnetic so to those who are not familiar with this type of folio it doesn't cover three sides frame okay right away I would like to say not just this iPad Mini 7 but the rest of the iPad Mini from what I know you can actually buy an iPad 10th Generation or even the iPad Air with the price point that I just told you when it comes to the design prepare to be disappointed pretty much this is the same tablet as before obviously color options so aside from Starlight we have blue purple and space green so Dimensions it's exactly the same and even the weight it still is 293 G light of course that is without the fol and then for the cellular version It's 297 G and for that weight and size perfect for commute mapa bus train or airplane Manan especially if you love reading this is the ideal size very similar with the Kindles it's the type of tablet that can be used comfortably with one hand at the same time this is also the tablet that made me sell my iPad Pro M4 Che indeed that is a downgrade if you're someone like me who value ease of use and comfortability at the same time touch it it remained the same it's on the topmost part at the same time you camera system is the same as well which is single lens now what made it disappointing which is what I put on our title click be I am disappointed still with its display jelly scrolling is real 62 higher refresh rate they could have made it into an OLED panel if you're also wondering front camera at the center for the landscape mode so yes right now this is the only ad that cannot do that but personally it's not a big deal to me main issue but when it comes to brightness even Outdoors it's brighter in comparison with the iPad 9th generation even brighter than the iPad air4 and even with the Galaxy Tab A7 light and that is because after 520 nits of peak brightness you I now to answer the question why did I trade my iPad Pro M4 with the iPad Mini number one priority when it comes to devices tala and this is because of how pocketable it is it's bigger than most of my smartphones but the experience is just a lot different at the same time max out specs iPad Pro which is why it's only smart to downgrade now let's talk about A7 Pro what's powering the iPad Mini obviously is the a77 pro and yes same chip that can be found from the iPhone 15 Pro iPhone 15 pro has a six core GPU and six core CPU iPad Mini is that 6 core CPU and 5 Core GPU which means when it comes to graphic performance and in real world and one of the reasons why they put that chip here is because of the Apple intelligence and personally this is what made my experience slightly better same with iPhones it features capabilities C clean up tool wherein it can erase objects from your background in apple photos or even writing tools wherein it can proof read your copy or changes the tone of your sentences audio transcribing Services notes and Voice Memos app chat GPT integration with CI and even gen mooji I was able to update my iPad to 18.1 but out of the box when I got my unit it's 18.0 and from what I I know there's more to come 18.2 but to be honest with you guys if you already have the six generation iPad mini and you want to find the reasons to upgrade to this 2024 model and you want it to be the Apple intelligence I don't think that's a really good reason but if your reason is that you are constantly downloading and playing high graphic mobile games and you want that graphical boost at the same time pencil Pro then sure go for it so yes I don't think Apple intelligence should be the sole reason for you to upgrade now lastly before we fully WRA up this video battery life you all know I love reviewing iPads and from Apple from iPad to iPad Air and even from the regular iPads and something is very familiar with those iPads battery life and to those who doesn't know Apple rarely state or disclose their exact milliamp hour so right now EXA and even iPad Mini 6 usually what they state is you hours that you can get according from their website we can get 10 hours of web browsing on Wi-Fi or watching video which is all throughout my usage very similar experience so yes for me claim is pretty accurate now charging it is done via USBC which is AED USBC to USBC cable now in certain regs UK countries like London I wouldn't suggest un now full charge it took us below 2 hours 1 hour 50 minutes it's always below 2 hours okay so for my verdict actually right now or in the market I wouldn't say those are from reliable Brands actually the closest you can get from this size are foldables which is again tablet those are still considered Smartphones at the end of the day I think it still is for those people who wants an excellent one-handed tablet experience for watching shows and reading books at the same time a bit of editing since I was able to do Final Cut Pro here a bit of gaming with no compromises and at this moment I don't think you will regret getting an iPad Mini which is also Al my experiencea regrets when I downgraded from my iPad Pro M4 overall it's a great tiny tablet with a modern chip of course that also supports the latest accessories C pencil Pro and of course the availability of Apple intelligence so basically if you get yourself an iPad Mini right now K papano it's already future proof not unless paresis your priority when it comes to buying a is a really good display considering price point so yes that's basically it again it's your Tech girl Mary and see you on our next video bye [Music]",hey guys it's your Tech girl Mary and welcome back to our YouTube channel yes this is probably your most requested video for this month and finally

@MaryBautista,Gold,9a42bdlFRxM,Tecno SPARK 30 Review: The GOOD and the BAD!,"maganda Ganda interval technos spark series if I remember it correctly it was last year of December when we last talk about the technos spark 20 Pro and now which is the technos spark 30 let's talk about it hey guys it's your Tech girl Mary and welcome back to our YouTube channel so let's talk about budget phones I personally don't like it interval predecessor to its successor usually increment upgrades anyway what I got here is the technos spark 3 Transformers edition smartphone spark 30 series spark 30 spark 30 5G and Spark 30 Pro don't worry as well cooli and Loud type of designs before I share with you unboxing experience spark 3T Transformers edition let's first talk about the pricing official SRP is 8,999 pesos but it will be available to Tik Tok shop for 5,699 pesos this is their first sale promo so discount rate is almost 4 % just because of the 40% my technos spark 30 review unit is in Transformers theme and you character that I have is Si bumblebee now if you are a fan of Optimus Prime that one is available for the technos spark 30 Pro unboxing and it's really giving actually sleeve also comes with the characters it's nice especially if you love collecting any Transformers merch so it doesn't pull out it spreads and it looks like this yellow and black is the main theme here because bumblebee is mainly yellow and black paperwork the case is clear it has a bumblebee text here and you design um case reminds me of the hood of the car version of bumblebe I remember that because of the Bumblebee movie anyway we have here the phone plastic unboxing experience for a budget phone this is how it looks like lastly of course power brick and charging cable Ang Ganda charging brick I um Transformers P guys Transformers simp P Lang this [Music] one overall look n device it's very loud again it's Transformers edition so if you're not a fan of that Transformers is Stellar Shadow and Asal ice I design technos spark 30 series if you remember the Techno spark 20 with the iPhones last year budget phones speaking of the cameras we have four here CA the other one is a flash the other one doesn't have a camera I guess they did this to bad how it looks I'll be honest with you guys fan when brands do this there's also a fingerprint sensor on the right side which is consistent most of the time from afar it doesn't look like an entry level device reminds me so much of the flagship gaming devices but of course once you hold itd and not like it's bad it also has a glossy surface obious SMUD just probably because of its color yellow touches gladly this device has an ip64 rating now that's on paper I have yet to test that if IP 64 rating but at least performance display cameras Focus budget phones but as well as durability now up front we got a 6.78 in of full HD Plus display display with a 990 HZ refresh rate last year it was only HD Plus so it was definitely a let down now they improved they made it 1080p which is good since budget phones guys HD Plus lag most of the time minimum 1080p gun it's good for simple media consumption at the same timez the overall viewing experience really niceo one of the standout features enjoy aside from it having a really nice appealing design is speakers for its price point dual stereo speakers which is also Atmos I wouldn't audio and it's clear enough to enjoy whatever I'm doing [Music] now when it comes to Performance obviously me changes then I wouldn't see well at least it improved from the previous mediatech Helio g85 we now are getting a mediatech helio g91 with the same configuration of 8 gig of RAM and 256 gig of internal storage actually this chipset entry level devices this year obviously Gamers high graphics or even heavy task and heavy multitasking if that's what you do then this is not the device for you but for simple day-to-day use In fairness the device was able to deliver now if you want to play something a bit more heavier I suggest you go for the pro version of this device now cameras earlier on this video I told you guys dala Lang cameras upon going back on my script Isa camera is an auxiliary sensor not entirely super important but the other camera is a 64 megap one front is 13 megap now if you want a bit of comparison previous device only has 50 megapixels and same with that device I wasn't also expecting a lot from this it's not color accurate a lot of times but at least it's not Overexposed outdoor conditions which is usually the downside some entry level devices by the way if you want to get the most out of your photos I suggest you toggle 64 megap mode since turned on by default and speaking of this tole Isa setting beside this which is we can choose from standard to bright I'm guessing this is more of e filter and I am guessing this is for HDR now for taking selfies biy Nang very useful especially when shooting in dark environments at this moment that I am reviewing this device this already comes with an Android 14 with high os1 14 skin similar P interface especially the camera app from the previous devices since this is a Transformers edition Transformers support updates device but I'm guessing almost maximum 2 years again devices something spark 20 last time you Dynamic Port kind of their take with the dynamic Island on iOS smartphones so halim during Face Unlock and even while you are charging laas and speaking of charging actually on this area and battery life not much has changed we still are getting 5,000 milliamp hour and 18 WS of fast charging battery life is really good charging wise almost 3 hours full charge 18 Watts on a 5,000 milliamp hour is not really fast charging not the greatest but we can't really expect from a smartph phone that is priced at around 5,000 pesos now let's talk about pricing if I remember it correctly the price last year of the technos park 20 was 6,999 pesos so yes when it comes to the official SRP the best advice that I can give you is maximize early bir price so you can still get it for less than 6,000 nevertheless it still is a great entry level smartphone at the same time I also think it's a great collector item piece anyway that's basically it again it's your T girl Mary and see you on our next video bye",maganda Ganda interval

@MaryBautista,Gold,pk9RKCRdWyc,HP EliteBook 840 G11 16”: BIG AND POWERFUL!,[Music] it's been almost 2 years since we last featured an HP loptop here on our YouTube channel so yes indeed it's been a while so ta let's talk about it hey guys it's your T girl Mary and welcome back to our YouTube channel for [Music] todaytop HP which is the elite book 840 G11 and size right now is the 16 in screen is because yes again 16 in this HP Elite book 840G 111 is powered by an Intel Core Ultra processor with Intel V Pro so yes indeed it is powerful stylish and 3D it also comes with features including those enhanced by AI overall this laptop were able to help my workload to become lighter I also noticed how good the audio is with this laptop probably because of the poly studio with AI noise reduction feature providing users a better audio experience even during work meetings at the same time this also has HP Smart Sense this optimizes the computer's system so it can help us deliver a more Superior work anyway let's start to those who doesn't know you Elite book series HP this is known for being a business line laptop though I've said it before and I'll say it again for me 14 in ideal size for a business laptop that's not too small not too bulky for having a 16in locktop bigger display bigger battery and a more complete keyboard speaking of its keyboard I find it really comfortable to use it's back lit and it automatically turns off then to preserve battery especially for a few minutes of inactivity also perfect for low light and nighttime use and since this is the 16in size compto keyboard May num pad which is very rare for you to see on a 16 in laptops 16 in included anyway underneath the keyboard trackpad trackpad it's really broad allowing us to use gestures without being hindered by physical buttons here anyway in terms of connectivity when it comes to my everyday usage it's actually good man laptop and the thin laptops typically mean few ports but with we still are getting one full HDMI port two USB type a 5G BPS ports dalawang Thunderbolt four ports nano SIM card slot and a 3.5 mm audio jack so indeed plenty of space p for your peripherals but personally I always use docking stations I guess personal preference laptop here in the studio we've been using this Elite book laptop for the past few days and I happy to say that this has become my go-to laptop for almost all my work needs which requires a lot of multitasking and high performance task so I need a laptop to keep up with those needs to make it more specific I do my research write scripts dump my photos and videos edit my Vlogs [Music] times final c pro at the same time creating shoot and posting schedules and even updating my spreadsheets basically reviewtop and good thing with this Elite book laptop AI features that is powered by Intel Core Ultra 5 processor with Intel V Pro it's also equipped with a 64 GB of RAM and with up to 2 terabytes of internal storage which is good cuz 2 terab is actually the right size for me for those task I mentioned with my previous laptops 52 gig to 1 TB storage good thing running out of space with this laptop is not my worry anytime soon this also has an Intel unison meaning guys I get to experience and enjoy full access to my mobile photo galleries from my PC and even get all my phone notifications directly through my PC's notification center so far we exper exp erience no performance related issues even from heavy gaming to conference video calls now when it comes to it being warm if actually we tested it for quite a while gaming test it's only noticeable when it's charging to the point that it's uncomfortable overall for me I think it is an excellent business and content creator laptop to coding or even regular home usage now before we officially end the video when it comes to security there is a webcam which has a 5 megapixel camera it does the job done but not much more very subtle privacy slider I appreciate that physical camera cover which is also a necessity for business laptops other than this fingerprint sensor below the keyboard so far it's accurate even if most of the time now when it comes to battery life Naman since this is a 16in laptop I get more battery life with it compared to the regular laptops that I usually use and review 6 to S hours with this one I was able to get 8 to 9 hours and that is under you standard operation like using Google Chrome watching Netflix a bit of gaming basically all the basic necessities I do on a laptop or in short multi-rod Unleashed with the HP Elite book 840 G11 which is also a major plus Point since it provides protection and security to documents like contracts or top secret ndas and other important files thanks to the HP wolf security and amp which is also the fingerprint sensor anyway there is a lot to like about this new HP Elite book 840 G11 laptop it's a well-built and well-designed laptop machine anyway to officially end this video if you're fine with having a non OLED display on a laptop or even a 4K display then you might want to take a look at hp's elitebook 840 G11 laptop from 5G mobile Broadband to an AI enhanced conferencing camera at the same time with a competitive performance so yes you will definitely unlock the power of AI for business with the Intel Core Ultra processor 5 with Intel V Pro anyway that's basically it again it's

@MaryBautista,Gold,H17T4dH7-W0,Infinix HOT 50 Pro+ Review: THE SLIMMEST GAMING PHONE?!,"oh wait is this really the slimmest smartphone in the world let's find out hey guys it's your Tech girl Mary and welcome back to our YouTube channel yep I missed reviewing infinix phones so and when I read the spec sheet of this device wow interesting so yes review it was actually earlier this year when they launched the infinix hot 40 series I never featured that on our YouTube channel perita Tik Tok so yep we have a point of comparison Nam and this time with honor of Kings collaboration anyway let's do a very quick unboxing removing the sleeve of course we have the trademark of infinix which is their color branded and a list of all the specs that you need to know Sound by JBL TUV certification and of course the 256 gig of storage obviously the phone is no longer here the clear case which is also hard jelly type of case we usually get which is perfect especially if you want to maintain that slim profile then case tala no pre-install tempered GL paperwork and USBC C lastly the infinex power brick Des also this comes in three color variants what I have is the one in titanium gray but this is also available in sleek black and dreamy purple purple In fairness and back finish is nice fingerprint actually smartphone mat smes but with this one even without a case I don't think you should worry now earlier on this video I said that this device is the slimmest one in the market but let's get our facts straight first actually term device in the worlda brand what the brand is claiming is that the infinix hot 50 Pro Plus is the slimmest 3D curved slim Edge design at 6.8 mm thin and I would like to add to that that this is also the slimmest device that has a 5,000 milliamp hour of battery capacity most of the devices CU that is part of the list of the slimmest devices doesn't have a 3D curve display and doesn't have a 5,000 mamp hour of battery capacity capacity device so yes Kos to infinix for being able to achieve this anyway aside from it being a really Slim device for its price point I notic design language hot series leaks for this device and I love infix iPhone like design giving them more identity it also comes with an ip54 dust and water resistance so light rain accidental water splash I don't think you will have a problem when it comes to those scenarios they were also able to make the speakers stereo I and and this is actually sound by JBL Sim slot and micro SD card slot is below and of course let's not forget the USBC Port that is also located here anyway since we are already talking about durability being it a very slim device is flex we all know when a device is dangerously thin like this it may be prone to bending biggest example to that that are the iPads so yes I had to ask the brand on the type of material they used here according to them they used feather light Wing design and tighten armor protection the feather light design emphasizes a featherlike lightness and ultra thin construction from which they achieve from rearrangement of components and space optimization anyway how is the display since this is a curved panel accidental touches first this one has a 6.78 in display size actually that's the same number that is found predecessor so it still is big but what's new is that finally we now have an AMOLED display with a 120 HZ refresh rate LCD display infinite hot 40 pro at the same time this has a corny gorilla glass protection as well again not bad for a budget phone you can also adjust the screen refresh rate in the settings so we have choices between 120 to 60 and of course the auto switch refresh rate while considering the device affordability but I do wish there is also an option for a 90 HZ refresh rate cuz if I remember it correctly you hot 40 Pro 90 HZ option but if you're all about watching media then you'll be glad to know 5year TUV fluency certification and since this has an amola display in display fingerprint sensor which is most of the time consistent n man with us but my problem is that it's just placed a little too low for my liking now what's impressive for me with all the things I mentioned Kina is probably the stereo speaker setup with phones these days even only have one speaker I appreciate that they collaborated with JBL as well and despite it being this really thin you max volume is there to a point that you don't even have to go full every time now let's talk about how much power can come in a slim body this device comes with a mediatech helio g100 and again 8 gig of RAM with 256 gig of internal storage this is also expandable micro SD card slot g100 smartes when it comes to gaming we did try the device for the games like honor of Kings as Asphalt 9 even genon impact well very inevitable Nam guys you lag so it's still there but In fairness it feels faster in comparison with other devices with the same price range for Gen and impact P tolerable gameplay is in low settings and of course lastly when it comes to its interface or the overall UI I kind of already expected that this will have a lot of bloat wear this may or may not ruin your experience actually depend expectations their UI keeps on improving now when it comes to battery life earlier on this video I did mention that this device comes with a 5,000 milliamp hour of battery capacity it's also capable of 33 Watts when it comes to Wi charging and as advertised they were saying that this can get 50% in just less than 27 minutes during our testing malapit on this numbers it took us around 31 minutes para 50% now how about the camera quality actually and box which means P least and that is why we are here to find out there's a 50 megapixels f1.6 main camera and then the two other cameras are unspecified I don't think the last camera is also a flashed flash there's no ultrawide prence Ultra wide camera priority I guess when it comes to their new device well image quality considering that this has 50 megapixels only it's far from perfect but for day-to-day it's good enough there is also a two times button if you want to do a digital Zoom sh Ed that the image quality will drop once I use the digital [Music] Zoo now the pricing actually infinix hot 50 Series it comes with three devices we have the hot 50i hot 50 Pro and even the hot 50 Pro Plus which is what we have itong hot 50 Pro Plus that we are currently reviewing only comes with one configuration which is what we have the 8 gig of RAM and 256 gig of storage the SRP will be 8,499 pesos and S Tik Tok shop 7,299 pesos from what I know up to 1,200 pesos off during their live giveaways anyway now that you already know how much this device retails for if you're one of those people whose top priority on a device is cameras I don't think this is the right one for you but if you want to get the best hardware for its price point I don't think you will be disappointed it has one of the best and solid build quality really nice display with impressive set of speakers so yes it's far from perfect but I think you will get value for money Nam man with this device anyway that's basically it again it's your Tech girl Mary and see you on our next video bye",oh wait is this really the slimmest smartphone in the world let's find out hey guys it's your Tech girl Mary and welcome back to our YouTube channel yep I missed reviewing infinix phones so and when I read the spec sheet of this device wow interesting so yes review it was actually earlier this year when they launched the infinix hot 40

@MaryBautista,Gold,8AuAv0eQlBI,Apple Watch Series 10 Quick Review: DON'T BUY... YET!,today we are finally talking about the 10th AG of Apple watch hey guys it's your Tech girl Mary and welcome back to our YouTube channel yes before you purchase or even before you pre-order here in the Philippines you might as well watch this first actually Apple watch 10th gen on this video but as well as the new Apple watch Ultra second gen not entirely new but this one is new because of its black finish actually itong black finish was what everyone was expecting and wanting from the launch of the ultra second gen aside from the new updated features we also want a new colorway again Nas that time what they did is to wait for another year to release it which is a very Apple move of them one of the reasons why I decided to create a dedicated YouTube video on their new Apple watches is probably because of how much I've been using it so far I'll be honest with you guys I am not the biggest fan of Apple watches well I used to but ever since I got myself Garmin and even Huawei watches which is why almost every year I buy an Apple Watch for review purposes I sell it immediately but this time it seems like I'll be keeping this one the Apple Watch series 10 still comes in two sizes we have the 42 mm and the 46 mm and obviously what I got is the one in 42 mm just the right size for my wrist while this one in Apple watch Ultra 2 in satin black this has a 49 mm if you're one of those people who still has an Apple Watch series 7 or who still remembers the Apple Watch series 7 it's actually the first major redesign ever since that watch why at that time cuz you Series 7 had a 20% larger display as compared to the Apple Watch series 6 and now Apple Watch series 10 has a 10% larger display as compared to the Apple Watch series 9 so yes if you still are using an Apple Watch series 6 30% larger display if you will get the series 10 anyway what else is new Apple watch series 10 is actually apples first with wide angle OLED technology and take note not even this watch the ultra has it this means you will get 40% brighter when it comes to off angle viewing compared traditional OLED screen that is used on the previous Apple watch but since I no longer have the series 9 with me compare and aside from this this Apple Watch series 10 at 9.7 mm 10% less thick as compared to the series 9 I mean visually and even on hand that's actually nice but you know what's nicer having a longer battery life from which we will talk about in a while from the series 9 I'll be honest noticeable change so if you're one of those series 9 owners I wouldn't think 10% thinness Bas if you remember we have a stainless steel option before together with the regular aluminum Apple watches so yes fully in stainless steel and replace it with titanium which is very similar to what they're doing with their recent iPhones May aluminum chice Kayo from the regular iPhone 16 and titanium choice for the iPhone 16 Pros fortunately then Apple watch bands from the previous Apple watches can still fit the new Apple watch series 10 if I remember it correctly guys itong Milan Loop which is in Gold Series 8 May so until now series 10 this is also the same case with the Apple watch Ultra second gen Apple watch straps for the first generation and actually not just that even some 45 mm Apple watch straps Ultra and if you are wondering Apple watch Ultra second is what you call Nan Loop in [Music] Black okay so one of the new things from the watch OS 11 at the same time with the new Apple watches is the sleep apnea addition with its health and wellness feature but take note guys watch watch1 is sleep apnea feature you can only have this if you have the recent Apple watch Ultra or even the Apple Watch series 10 and even the Apple Watch series 9 make sure running on iOS 18 smartphone and of course your Apple watch has the watch OS 11 sleep app notification Health app and on a nightly basis or breathing disturbances although immediately you have to have at least 10 nights in one month for you to be able to receive an alert of whether May possible sleep apne and anyway Watch series 10 is the new speakers yes an Apple watch that has speakers meaning you can listen to podcast or even music while you're doing your thing like you're running you forgot your earphones In [Music] fairness voice isolation feature to reduce background noise on phones and FaceTime calls somehow the same feature that can be found on the airpods pro too so even without any wireless earphones um loud places like for example concert or you are coming from any loud place the caller from the other end will still be able to clearly hear your voice now let's talk about battery life I've had almost all the Apple watches and again deal breaker tal is battery life considering that some fitness watches can offer us even up to 2 weeks so so yes my opinion will remain the same this will still be my biggest disappointment and in my test almost every day routine Co which is viewing notifications from my Apple watch setting timers almost 2 hours of exercise this depends if it's running or um weightlifting GPS if outdoor running and lastly of course sleep tracking yes I'm not much a big fan of wearing a smart watch while sleeping per since we are reviewing the Apple watch P it and with those I was able to get maximum of a day every end of the day Arrow Arrow I had to charge my Apple Watch series 10 which is the same case with my series 9 and yes with that routine I mentioned earlier music using the new speakers so imagine if battery life but gladly charger series 10 I for you to get at least 80% of charging in just 30 minutes you have to use G charger and of course pair it with a 20 W adapter anyway actually that's basically it I wouldn't say revolutionary changes from the series 9 to the series 10 actually this is the case Nam man in almost all of their products you need at least siguro 3 years Gap to find a difference but to answer the question on why I no longer want to sell my series 10 this year is probably the color I love gold accessories even smart rings I always choose gold and rarely Smartwatch gold which is why I opted for this Gold Titanium aside from this I also really appreciate the wearability I love how it sits on my wrist perfectly and it's not too heavy actually Pro for having titanium Bast Kai but as well as a lighter weight so if we were not to look at the battery life I really think the Apple Watch series 10 is the perfect Smartwatch for you series series 9 time for you to upgrade unless you have the money to spend but if not tap blood oxygen Apple watch or also your sleep looking at your notifications and even um a bit of sports then your Apple Watch series even 7 onwards is good enough 10 perfect anyway that's basically it again it's your T girl Mary and see you on our next video bye,today we are finally talking about the 10th AG of Apple watch hey guys it's your Tech girl Mary and welcome back to our YouTube channel yes before you purchase or even before you pre-order here in the Philippines you might as well watch this first actually Apple watch 10th gen on this video but as well as the new Apple watch Ultra second gen not entirely new but this one is new because of,0.0,0.999,0.7227
@JerryRigEverything,Gold,FZzZatxb9KQ,NEW iPhone 16 Durability Test! - They hid all the good stuff...,"Apple released this blue-colored ultramarine 
iPhone 16 Plus about a month and a half ago,   along with the regular-sized iPhone 16, which I 
have here in teal. But unless I'm seeing things,   it looks like just another shade of blue. The 
iPhone 16 lineup is more colorful and more   affordable, but let's be honest— not much has 
changed on the outside. On the inside, however,   there have been a lot of updates. But if we jump 
straight to the teardown and skip the durability   test, the TVA might show up at my house with 
a pruning baton, and we don't want that. Luckily, I still have what's left of the iPhone 
16 Pro Max. As we saw from its internals,   there was regular sticky adhesive with 
pull tabs under the battery. Turns out,   this cheaper iPhone 16 uses a new electrically 
debonding adhesive under the battery that   separates with an electric shock. And 
I cannot tell you how excited I am to   electrocute an iPhone battery just to see what 
happens—after the durability test, of course. We should also find that the iPhone 16 has 
the same Stonehenge-style ring of magnets   around the wireless charging coil, which 
is something my channel sponsor, EcoFlow,   is taking full advantage of. They've even borrowed 
the same magnetic layout for their EcoFlow RAPID   Magnetic Power Bank, which magnetically 
docks to the back of the iPhone 16 with   its own corresponding set of magnets—just 
like a resupply mission to the space station. Not only does it look sleek and magnetically 
secure to the blue iPhone 16, but it also has   enough juice inside to fully recharge your 
phone—5,000 milliamp hours. Using G2 15-watt   ultra-fast wireless charging, you can get 50% of 
that charge in about 42 minutes. It also has a   kickstand for hands-free doom scrolling, which is 
important these days. If you need juice faster,   the USB-C port can output 30 watts, getting 
you to 50% in about 25 minutes. The attached   USB-C cord can charge multiple devices at 
the same time—like your iPhone and AirPods,   or it can even add 4 hours' worth 
of emergency juice to a MacBook. So,   you never have to ""raw dog"" a 
flight or miss a Minecraft sesh. We'll see if it can actually charge two phones 
at once, since I do have this other shade of   blue iPhone 16 Plus to give away later—if it 
survives. The EcoFlow RAPID Magnetic Power   Bank has an internal BMS battery sensor that 
checks charging efficiency 50 times a second for   optimal performance. And look at that—charging two 
devices at once. It's a very sleek little unit. If   you want an EcoFlow RAPID charger for your own 
iPhone, I'll leave a link in the description. Seeing Apple release two different shades of 
blue this year is kind of trippy. One thing I do   appreciate about Apple is their new ceramic shield 
material on the 6.1-inch screen. It actually does   seem to be more scratch-resistant than other 
smartphones. Working our way up through the Mohs   scale of hardness, usually I can feel the level-6 
pick grab the glass and start scratching, but with   this latest generation of ceramic shield, it still 
feels pretty smooth—even with that sharp level-6   pick. The marks still appear, but they're so faint 
and subtle that I almost can't call them scratches   at a level-6 anymore. The deeper grooves 
appear at level-7, but just barely. Almost. Moving up to the Dynamic Island, we find a 
12-megapixel selfie camera protected by the   same slab of glass, with a super-thin earpiece 
slit nestled up against the blue frame. This is   a great year for Apple fans who like the 
color blue. The sapphire crystal-covered   camera control button, however, seems 
to be universally disliked. Nice work,   Apple—getting everyone to agree on 
something is difficult these days. Up at the top of the phone, we have more 
aluminum—85% of which is recycled. And even   more shocking than the recycled aluminum 
frame is the fact that Apple is using 95%   recycled lithium in the battery, and 100% 
of the cobalt in the battery has also been   recycled. That's a massive accomplishment, and 
Apple deserves all the thumbs up for that one. At the bottom of the phone, we have 
our 25-watt USB-C port, loudspeaker,   and the dual voice-isolation, wide-spectrum 
microphones. Zooming in on the Apple logo on   the matte glass back panel, you can see that 
the texturing is much better centered on this   logo than what we saw on the Pro model, which is 
interesting. Apple has better quality control on   the cheaper versions of their phone. Even 
here, on the other blue iPhone 16 Plus,   the texturing is better centered than 
on the Pro Max we saw a few weeks ago. And while we're here, I might as well charge 
up the giveaway phone so the winner can start   using it right away. Both the 16 and 
the 16 Plus have the same cameras:   vertically stacked spatial sensors 
with a 48-megapixel main camera on   the bottom and a 12-megapixel wide-angle 
lens up top. The tiny hole in the glass   is for a directional microphone, and 
the single-tone LED flash is plastic. Now, as far as the screen goes, Apple does have to 
throttle something to make the Pro phones better,   and in this case, the pixel density, brightness 
(nits), and OLED panel are all the same.   The only differences are that the bezels are 
slightly wider, and it's limited to a 60Hz   refresh rate instead of 120Hz. But honestly, 
ain't nobody noticing a difference anyway,   so you might as well save yourself $200 
and pick your favorite shade of blue. Finally, the bend test. Choosing the 
cheaper iPhone doesn't do us any good   if it's not durable, but luckily 
for Apple (and unlucky for us),   the iPhone 16 is unfazed and unbendable from 
both the front and the back. The aluminum   frame is just as secure and rigid as 
the more expensive iPhone 16 Pro's   titanium frame. However, the 6.1-inch display 
feels kind of small to me—I'm used to holding   my much larger Samsung S24 Ultra. Maybe the 
larger iPhone 16 Plus will snap in half for us. Swapping over the EcoFlow RAPID 
Magnetic Power Bank from the 16   Plus to the regular 16 and running the 
bend test again with the giveaway phone,   we get absolutely no carnage, 
no flexing, no creaking,   and no compromising of that water resistance. 
I guess all Apple's iPhones survive this year. Leave a comment—any comment—down below, 
and I'll pick a random winner to receive   this gently used iPhone 16 Plus. And maybe 
I'll even throw in EcoFlow's RAPID Magnetic   charger if my wife doesn't want to keep it for 
her phone. These are surprisingly inexpensive,   and I'll leave a link down in the description. The blue iPhone 16 still has some things to go 
through, like electrocution. Hit that subscribe   button so you don't miss it, and thanks 
a ton for watching. I'll see you around!","Apple released this blue-colored ultramarine iPhone 16 Plus about a month and a half ago, along with the regular-sized iPhone 16, which I have here in teal.

@JerryRigEverything,Gold,PIun_aBsRMA,The Tri Folding Phone Durability Test! - someone has to try...,"The Huawei Mate XT Ultimate is probably the most futuristic Flagship on this planet right now, and probably the largest leap in smartphone evolution. Since LG had that crazy unit with the sideways flipping screen, may they rest in peace. This smartphone has two hinges and three screens. Making it the world's first triple folding screen smartphone. When fully extended the smartphone is nearly the same size as an iPad. I mean, yeah, it does cost about $3,000, and for that price you could probably duct tape three iPhones together and get almost the same effect. But there is a lot we can learn about this new form factor and with Huawei getting 65 million pre-orders I'm sure there are a lot of people with some very valid questions about the long-term durability of their future device. Which is why I'm here. Right off the bat we get the same warnings as all the other folding phones like the Galaxy fold and the Motorola Razor. Things like don't remove the screen protector and don't press too hard on the screen or it might get damaged. Size-wise transforming from iPad status back into its phone form puts the Mate XT right about the same size as my Galaxy s24 Ultra in a case. Pretty mind-blowing to get so much screen real estate in such a small package. The Mate XT can be a 6.4 inch 8 inch or 10.2 inch display on a moment's notice, and when either of the two wings get folded in very strong magnets hold everything into that closed position. It's a bit discombobulating at first knowing which flat folds where and I'm a tad nervous that it might break on accident before I can break it on purpose. I also have an extremely bad feeling about the soft folding screen being permanently exposed on the outside. And, more importantly, that same soft screen wrapping around the exterior edge of the main bend. It's very much unprotected all of the time. The exposed radius receiving even a small impact from a drop or brush with metal keys that are in the same pocket would probably destroy the entire phone, and I'm not sure it can handle the same abuse that our regular brick style smartphone encounters on the daily. But as you know we will find out for sure what its limits are here in a few minutes with a few of my specialized tools. And I might regret this, but from now until Christmas all of my Jerry rig knives including the transparent edition are just $9.99 until they're gone. All the knives except for the 24 karat gold plated version that'll stay expensive for obvious reasons. We're starting the sale early this year to keep the holidays a little less hectic for my team. Which of course is incredibly easy with my longtime channel sponsor stamps.com and their super simple shipping. See stamps.com lets any person or business buy postage and ship directly from their home or office using just a computer and a printer. Holidays are hectic and it's nice to have an early start while avoiding the long lines at the post office. We ship the knives in these recycled paper mailers. Which even have padding on the inside made from paper. It's like a plastic bubble mailer but actually recyclable. You can get up to 89% off UPS and USPS rates and seamlessly connect with every major marketplace and shopping car, if your small business is online. Doing so all from your phone or computer. Day or night no lines no traffic and no waiting. You can even schedule pickups and order shipping supplies through the stamps.com dashboard. More holiday, less hustle. You can free up more time with stamps.com. To get your four-week trial free postage and free digital scale just head to stamps.com/Jerryrig. No long-term commitments or contracts just how we like it, stamps.com/Jerryrig. 
Now when we get a screen that can flex, plastic is what we expect. The only way to verify though is with the Mohs scale of hardness. Using the level two Mohs pick, which is also made from plastic, we start seeing some indentions and deformations at a level two with deeper grooves at a level three. The entire screen of the Mate XT Ultimate both inner and outer is fingernail scratchable levels of plastic. Which of course is not a deal breaker. Just good information to have. Plastic is not necessarily a bad thing, but just like you wouldn't hang drywall wearing a Rolex or take a Lambo off-roading. Actually that does sound kind of fun, but all I'm saying is as a daily driver the Mate XT requires clean pockets and a bit of extra attention. The inner 8 megapixel selfie camera. Which I won't touch with my Razor is covered with that same soft plastic. With the screen turned off the scratch marks from my fingernails and plastic tools appear even more visually apparent. I don't want the soft screen to distract from what a phenomenal technological achievement this phone has accomplished, cuz for reference, if you remember Apple also made their thinnest product ever this year with the iPad Pro at 5.1 mm thick. This Mate XT Ultimate clocks in at four. It's quite mind blowing to hold. The frame appears to be made from aluminum including the hinge nibblets. The Mate XT does have stereo loudspeakers. The right side of the phone has the metal volume rocker as well as a side mounted fingerprint scanner inside that power button. The three sides of the bottom contain another loudspeaker a 66 Watt USBC Port that's capable of 5 watt reverse wire charging and a few microphones. We do have a SIM card tray. Which does have a gray rubber ring around the opening, but no official IP or dust resistant rating. It's wild to see however that the thickness of the physical USB cable that I'm plugging into the phone is actually thicker than the phone itself. It's like technology out of a science fiction movie. Also there are rumors of a global launch for this Mate XT Ultimate in 2025. Assuming of course that we're all still here. Making our way over to the back the only part of this phone that's thick is the camera bump. We have a 12 megapixel Ultra wide camera in the top left corner. The main 50 megapixel variable aperture lens is on the bottom, and the 12 megapixel 5 times telephoto is in the upper right with the laser autofocus below that. All all of which are sitting inside the star diamond designed Damascus steel looking camera bump. The red leather, which I'm not sure if it's real or not, definitely has a nice textured feel and the inlaid Huawei branding and ultimate design script won't be falling out or coming out on its own. There's a 50 watt wireless charging pad underneath this panel. Which we might be lucky enough to see here in a second. The center panel is blank, and the far panel has a designed and crafted by Huawei token embedded into the leather. The token is made from metal. The internally folding hinge similar to the spine on Samsung's folding phone is made from metal. While the externally folding hinge has the soft screen on the spine. Which means I'm not going to scratch it just yet. The Damascus looking steel ring around the camera units however, is made from metal. The fully unfolded Mate XT Ultimate has a 3K resolution 90 HZ LTPO OLED with 1 billion colors. The blue J in the background looks kind of like that Twitter bird before it was murdered. Under flame the screen last for about 10 seconds before discoloring and the surface layer literally melting. Huawei has promised that the top layer of the external screen is eligible for free replacements, but the screen itself like the pixel part of it if damaged outside of warranty would cost about $1,100 to fix. Which is surprisingly less than I thought it would be. Now remember I do not delight in the destruction or decimation of devices. I'm just here to eloquently educate on the endurance of electronics. Where normally if a regular smartphone got accidentally covered in sand it wouldn't be the end of the world there might be some micro scratches or abrasions on the glass from the quartz or other hard minerals in the aggregate, but it would ultimately be fine. On a folding phone though especially one as premium and finely tuned as this one sand is a death sentence. Not from the folding screen itself, now surprisingly that's still alive and holding its own, but the hinges of the XT Ultimate immediately fill up with dirt and become unusable. It's a incredibly painful sound. I've been doing this dirt test on folding phones for about 5 years now and this is the worst grinding we've ever encountered. The hinge is so full even after just a few pinches of sand that it won't close anymore this $3,000 triple folding smartphone is decidedly decimated by a dash of dirt. Going back to the exposed outer radius of the soft folding screen. Huawei knows that is a weak point on the device. Which is why they've included a protective back panel case that flips up to protect the exposed edge. Definitely nice! Protection is always a good thing. I am still curious though what would happen if that bit of exposed screen did get impacted during a drop or get squeezed up against something in your pocket. Using a tiny pebble to press up against the screen nothing happens. I am using quite a bit of force here, but this rock is small and the phone is still unscathed and fully operational. Besides some some cosmetic impressions in the plastic. However using my recently discounted to 999 Jerry rig knife. I can tap the handle against the exposed bend, and on the third strike, with less force than it would have received during a drop, the inner pixels fracture and start bleeding Black Ink. In a Venom like symbiote the ink permanently blemishes the 3K resolution screen. Killing the pixels underneath. It is absolutely imperative that the Mate XT Ultimate not only stay away from dust, but also never receive an impact on the front unprotected flat display. The Mate XT Ultimate is a marvelous testament to modern engineering and an excellent showpiece. But it's definitely not ready for the harsh environments of everyday living. One thing that wasn't immediately intuitive is knowing which side folds which direction. Especially since the phone works in any orientation. However it appears as if Huawei has thought of this as well and has introduced sensors inside the phone to vibrate and notify you if you're bending in the wrong direction. This is is the first smartphone to ever beg for its life during the bend test. Which almost makes me want to give it a chance. The Mate XT Ultimate can indeed be catastrophically bent in the wrong direction. Again, worth repeating, that a device built for upscale eloquence should be treated delicately. With the device dead it would be doing a disservice if we didn't disassemble the different divides. The rear panel can pretty much be pulled away without heat. Exposing a battery in each of the individual sections. The main camera unit segment doesn't come away quite as easily, but it will. The two batteries we have exposed so far are the same size, 1,930 Milliamp hours. With a bit more persuasion from my Jerry rig knife the rear panel and Damascuc steel camera lens housing does come away from the body. Revealing the absolutely beautiful internals of the Huawei Mate XT Ultimate. Dual folds triple batteries, and if you look closely you can see the variable aperture camera open for one last time. The design is exquisitely complex. It's like seeing three phones get taken apart for the price of three phones getting","The Huawei Mate XT Ultimate is probably the most futuristic Flagship on this planet right now, and probably the largest leap in smartphone evolution.

@JerryRigEverything,Gold,IFthVfjoVOc,The Gaming Pad from 2030 just arrived today...,"Now I don't consider myself too much of a gamer, but when someone releases a tablet that can compete with the iPad Pro for half the price it's time to pay attention. This is the Red Magic Nova a gaming pad with an internal RGB turbo fan, and a laptop grade cooling system. All for just 500 bucks. Cheaper than even a lot of smartphones. Red magic did send me two of these tablets. One for testing and one for well, you'll find out later. Starting off, we have an 80 watt charging brick In the box. Apple's iPad Pro comes with a measly 20 watt block and some stickers. Just to throw some more dirt in the wound since Apple no longer includes any. Flipping our way around to the back of the gaming pad we can see the internal RGB cooling fan. It's extremely interesting that this time around there are no external vents for this fan like we normally see in the Red Magic Smartphones. At least no external vents that I can immediately see around its housing. There is a transparent glass panel on the back with more RGBs in the Red Magic logo and a decorative facade below that glass that has the very unholy matrimony of a flathead and Phillips screw side by side. but I'll ignore this oversight sense transparent tech is the best tech. The Red Magic Nova has more of a widescreen layout than other tablets. Since it's built specifically for gaming. While it can be a notepad or e-reader its 10.9 in 2.8k resolution screen is completely centered around optimal viewing for video games. For reference the Nova has 312 pixels per inch while the iPad Pro is only 264. Which is a big difference in the level of detail it can display while gaming. They both however start scratching in level six with deeper grooves at level 7. Taking a look at the body with its slightly chamfered edges. The 80 watt USBC port and two loudspeakers are protected by a metal frame. The volume rocker is also metal. The far side has an additional two stereo loudspeakers bringing our total to four. Along with a side mounted recess power button that doubles as a fingerprint scanner. Lastly similar to the iPad Pro we have some circular pins for optional accessories. Maybe Red Magic will be coming out with the keyboard or something else in the future. I'm not too sure. Making our way around to the back, with the subtle glow from the fans RGBs, we see that the back panel is made from metal. Now back in my day there was one game far more popular than all of the others. I'm not going to tell you which one but it involved a special weapon, and now is supposedly getting an Unreal Engine 5 reboot. Which is awesome. Also this is probably one of my worst drawings of all time. Only true gamers are going to know what this is so let me know down in the comments if you get it. Analyzing the 20,000 RPM 17 mm turbo fan next to the rear 50 megapixel camera. It really does not appear to have any external venting I'm curious if the math works out to where it has enough internal air to circulate without self throttling. We'll have to take a look at the insides here in a second if the tablet snaps in half. Because heat dissipation is a very important aspect of high-end gaming hardware. The Nova screen has 140 HZ refresh rate with an 840 HZ touch sampling rate. Meaning it can sense your finger before the screen even displays what's going on. Which is impressive. All with 550 nits of IPS LCD brightness. As we can tell from the black spot that's forming that does eventually completely recover. Now while a tablet doesn't necessarily have to be as durable as a smartphone or Game Boy. It's still good to know what his physical limits are, and how much abuse it can theoretically handle. And in the case of this Red Magic Nova gaming pad at first glance, when bending from the front it appears extremely solid, but flipping it around and bending from the back, where the glass isn't there to constrain it, we do get a very substantial flex. Not along the center point either it's more of a diagonal flex which is strange, and the kink that follows is very permanent. We aren't here to judge though at least it didn't snap in half. With no cracks or catastrophic damage though, I say the nothing gaming pad survives. It'll live through normal wear and tear just fine but probably not a rage quit. However the internal ventless cooling fan still has me curious, and I think we deserve to see how that looks from the inside. Using quite a lot of heat to soften the adhesive around the edges of the large screen. There is no official IP rating. Which means in theory air should still be able to enter and exit through those speaker holes. With the adhesive cleanly sliced away by my Jerry Rig knife and suction cup. The front screen folds open like a book. The IPS ribbons are plugged into the motherboard near the front-facing 20 megapixel selfie camera. I'll peel off the upper mainboard copper foil. This helps get the heat off the top side of the motherboard and into the aluminum panel on the back side the display. The RGB turbo fan has eight screws holding it in place, and interestingly enough has no ribbons or plugs. Just gold contact pads where the fans rest up against the motherboard. Definitely a cool little unit. I'll take three screws off of the screen's metal bracket and then unplug the screen ribbons just like little Legos. With our first glimpse inside the Nova's body we see four large speakers and a modular charging port. Which is good. The 50 megapixel rear camera is accessible at this point as well but doesn't not have any Optical image stabilization. There are small haptic feedback motors on either side of the base of the tablet. Which when held horizontally give directional gaming feedback similar to a gaming controller. Like we would see on an Xbox or Playstation, and it looks like the speakers do have waterproofing mesh over each opening, and the speakers themselves are made with rubber speaker cones to help with water resistance. But we aren't here for speakers or vibrators. I want to see what that heat pipe and venting system look like. With about 9 more screws removed from the upper motherboard and the battery is unplugged. The main board can lift up and away from the frame revealing a thermal pace connection to the 103 mm copper heat pipe that's embedded and sandwiched into the frame. It looks like the fan does indeed have a direct connection to that Vapor chamber. And can pull the internal tablet air over that copper, and spit it out the left side near the battery. Circulating the air in a giant circle all throughout the tablet. I would imagine though that the bulk of the cooling comes from the traditional legacy layout. Where the copper is thermally dissipating its heat through the back aluminum shell. Red Magic says the fan helps improve cooling efficiency by 30%. Which is probably true. Just a little guy doing the best he can, but the bulk of the heat still gets out through the back of the tablet and through the screen The last massive perk besides the 80 watts of fast charging is the 10,100 milliamp hours worth of battery. For reference the iPad Pro only has 8,160, and while it's plugged in the red Magic Pro bypasses the battery entirely to power the motherboard without adding additional Cycles to the battery's lifespan. Thumbs up for that and check it out everything still works including our little RGB cooling fan. If you made it this far in the video just subscribe and leave a comment. And thanks to Red Magic for sending an extra gaming pad. I'll pick a random winner to get this brand new sealed Red Magic Nova. Thanks a ton for watching, and I'll see you around.","Now I don't consider myself too much of a gamer, but when someone releases a tablet that can compete with the iPad Pro for half the price it's time to pay attention. This is the Red Magic Nova a gaming pad with an internal RGB turbo fan, and a laptop grade cooling system. All for just 500 bucks. Cheaper than even a lot of smartphones. Red magic did send me two of these tablets. One",0.0,0.9989,0.3291
@JerryRigEverything,Gold,VS66VOUmoKQ,The Scratchable Truth about BLACK TITANIUM Apple Watch Ultra 2,"The last time Apple released a special shade of black was 8 years ago. It was called, Jet Black and it appeared on the iPhone 7. It was quite possibly one of the most easily scratchable pieces of technology on the planet. So scratchable in fact that Apple themselves even recommended using a case. So it's only fair now that when Apple releases a new shade of black, on this Apple Watch 2 Ultra, that people have questions on its durability. Which is what I'm here for and probably why you've subscribed. I answer though those difficult questions. If this video gets over 30,000 likes I'll give this watch away to a random person in the comments. Assuming of course it survives. The worst part is I can't even turn this Apple watch on since I don't have any iPhones that are still in one piece, and it needs to attach itself to an iPhone before it can even tell me the time. But for this particular video we can all agree that it's what's on the outside the counts. The screen is sapphire and registers as a gemstone. Which is good. The back dark zirconia is also registering as a gemstone. For reference my $14 Casio f91w, which tells time without a chaperone, does not have a sapphire display, but makes up for that with a 7-year battery life. Which is 851 times longer than Apple's 3-day battery life. On the back it says the Ultra 2 is water resistant to 100 meters. To my American audience that's about as deep as 27 elephants. And while it's rated to 100 meters Apple suggest not diving beyond 40 meters or about 10 elephants. Which is fair since waterproofing diminishes over time, and you don't want to play chicken with that failure point. Apple says this new satin black titanium is made from a diamond like carbon PVD coating. Meaning they blasted carbon particles onto the titanium surface to get this space gray shade of black, and so far it's holding up light years better than the jet black color of the iPhone 7. Which was damageable by toothpick. This Apple watch Ultra 2 is toothpick damage free. Moving to a slightly more abrasive material this is a 55 grain 223 Remington. Which might look familiar if you watch a lot of military movies or attend school in the USA. The tip of this round is called an FMJ or Full Metal Jacket meaning that there's a lead core inside the projectile with a harder metal jacket surrounding the outside. In this case probably copper and the copper is what we need it for. Copper is a level three on the most scale of hardness and the lead it surrounding is a mo 1.5. But even with that pointy level three copper tip aggressively rubbing up against the diamondlike PVD coating we see some material transfer from the FMJ to the DLC PVD, but it does not appear to be doing any permanent damage to the coating or the watch itself, and the dust wipes almost completely away with my fingers. So far Apple's black titanium is appearing far more durable than I anticipated. Moving on to a set of keys, these are probably made from a brass or steel alloy, anywhere from a 3 to five on most scale of hardness. And again the invincible satin coating of the black titanium comes out victorious. You might think a sharp zinc plated steel construction screw would shatter some dreams but nope. The black titanium for the most part is still very much intact with just a bit of material transfer. Apple definitely learned their lesson from the jet black iPhone days. However, I'm not yet out of tools and my matte black Jerry rig knife wants to turn with the matte black titanium. These steel razor blades are about a five on most scale of hardness, and just like an anodized or PVD coded smartphone this DLC PVD does take damage at this level. Moving over to the other side. Taking my orange Jerry rig knife to the orange action button. I'm almost sold out of these orange Jerry rig knives by the way, so if you want one now's the time. And I'll put a link down in the description. I guess it's just comforting to know that the black titanium Apple watch Ultra is just as cosmetically durable as a regular smartphone. Keep in mind though that if it does scratch the scratch marks shine through as silver. A bare titanium color, but it's definitely not as fragile as the people familiar with jet black are expecting. The 100% recycled grade 5 black titanium can handle normal wear and tear just fine. Thanks to whoever wins this for letting me scratch up the edges, but like I always say never leave a surface unscratched. Honestly I think the Apple watch Ultra is probably the most innovative and premium product Apple was ever invented. With sapphire on the front a titanium body and a plethora of awesome fitness features that I'll never get to see since I use an Android. The software being ecosystem locked seems kind of petty but we wouldn't want peasants profaning the public perception of Apple's perfection now would we? We do see scratches at a level seven with deeper grooves at a level eight. Still the same Sapphire Apple's always been using and the crystal on the back appears to be the same substance. It's just as much of a blingy bracelet as it is a technological time piece, and I'll just keep wearing my f91w. Anyway grab a Jerry Rig Knife. I am about to run out of orange, and thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.","The last time Apple released a special shade of black was 8 years ago.

@JerryRigEverything,Gold,qYztDs8vPBg,iPhone 16 Pro MAX Durability Test - Apple tried hard this year...,"Apple is here again flaunting titanium on the new iPhone 16 Pro Max. At first glance it appears to be the same titanium exoskeleton design that we saw last year. That's bonded to an aluminum mid-frame with solid state diffusion. I successfully debonded my own titanium iPhone 15 Pro Max last year, and this was all the titanium that was used in the build. I imagine they'll be milking this titanium exoskeleton thing for the next few years. It's actually pretty nifty stuff and of course I'm always impressed by Apple's ability to run an hour and a half event over what essentially boils down to slapping a new number on the box. And while I personally do believe Apple's whole event this year could have been an email. There are a few subtle improvements on this 16 Pro Max that we should take a look at. There's a braided USBC cable Inside the box. This included cable can only transfer data at USB 2 speeds and not the USB 3 speeds that the iPhone 16 Pro Max is capable of. Kind of a bummer getting throttled right out of the box like that, but Apple fans are used to it. This shade is aptly named desert titanium. Desert's the right word since it's definitely the color of dehydration. The singular new physical feature that Apple has graced us with this year is the sapphire plated camera control button on the right side of the phone. Apple has gone out of their way to not call it a button even though it most definitely is. The coolest part about this button is not its ability to act as a shutter button or control the camera zoom. Is that it's supposedly covered with an actual sapphire crystal. Since not only is the button clicky, but also capacitive. Meaning it can sense full presses half presses and subtle strokes of your finger. I imagine Apple is using sapphire because one, it's smooth and slick, but also because of its thermal conductivity. The watts per meter kelvin of glass is around a one watts per meter kelvin is just the units used to measure thermal conductivity and not something you have to remember. It's not going to be on the quiz, but the watts per meter kelvin of sapphire crystal is a whopping 35. A huge increase in sensitivity not to be confused, of course, with diamonds though. Which have over 2,000 watts per met kelvin thermal sensitivity. I don't think we'll see Apple rolling out any diamond covered capacitive buttons anytime soon though. They can barely give us the right cable in the box. The sapphire Apple is using though is the same Sapphire that Apple has always been using. Although subtle I do see marks at levels 5 6 7 and 8. While pure Sapphire would only scratch at levels 8 or 9. It might be due to the micro fracturing of whatever cutting process Apple's using to extract the button shape from the large sapphire boules. You can see that even with my gem tester the sapphire button barely registers as a gemstone on the digital readout. My Cassio F91W has a glass screen. Which obviously doesn't move the meter, but if we take a look at pure sapphire on a Tissot watch or an actual brick of sapphire. Don't ask where I got it. The reading goes off the charts. Apple’s sapphire has always been a bit of a let down, but it's cool to see them trying something new with the camera control button. I do hope someday Apple perfects the sapphire manufacturing process enough to create entire screens from the material. But for now it appears as if they are sticking with the ceramic infused glass once again. Wobbling seems rather excessive. They said their ceramic shield this year is 50% tougher than the first generation ceramic shield. And two times tougher than any smartphone glass found in any other smartphone, but it still scratches at a level six with deeper grooves at a level seven. Glass is glass. And no matter how many adjectives are added in front of the word, it will still break. And apple is charging a whopping $379 to repair broken screens. If you want to preemptively save your screen for a fraction of that cost, but the idea of applying a screen protector gives you anxiety. My channel sponsor dbrand has you covered with their all new prism 2.0. This recyclable tray has a screen protector suspended inside. Precisely positioned for the perfect alignment on your screen. When the clear liner is pulled out it statically charges against the glass of your device pulling away any particles for a clean dust-free installation. Just swipe down the middle and give a few seconds for the adhesive to work its magic and just like that a perfectly installed screen protector. Protecting against scratches while also being a buffer layer for impacts. Each order comes with two protectors, so you'll have a spare for later. I'll drop a link down in the description for you to get a pair for yourself. The upper front-facing 12 megapixel camera is protected by that same front glass. With an itty bitty razor thin earpiece slit between the glass and the titanium frame. Speaking of which… The PVD coated grade five titanium exoskeleton can indeed be scratched just as easily as anodized aluminum. Obviously the camera control is sapphire but the raised buttons themselves feel the same to my Jerry Rig knife as the frame does. And based on the fact that the buttons survived the furnace last year and blued the same way as the titanium frame. I would say the buttons as well are also titanium. The top of the iPhone 16 Pro Max is also titanium. Along with the left side, volume buttons, and action button. The bottom has our stereo loudspeakers and our USBC 3.0 port, that you'll need to buy a new cable for to fully take advantage of. Coming around to the backside we find our soft touch matte texture all over the back glass. Except for the Apple logo itself. Which is super smooth. This texturing process usually starts with a smooth glass slab and uses a cream applied through a stencil or silk screen to eat away the glass leaving a frosted texture behind. It's interesting though that the stencil Apple used on this particular 16 Pro Max is misaligned just enough to give a perfectionist out there some PTSD, and I'm sorry for that. The main 48 megapixel Fusion camera lens it's slightly raised out of a metal ring. Which is slightly raised out of a glass plateau. Which is slightly raised out of the back glass panel. The 48 megapixel ultra wide camera is perched just above the first one. And the 12 megapixel five times telephoto camera sits alone off to the right.The cameras are lined up this way to film in spatial video for the three people who own vision pros. I would admit that filming at 120 frames per second in 4k would also be extremely impressive if Samsung hadn't already done it first in their s24 Ultra. But you know how it is over at Apple yesterday's tech for tomorrow's prices. Another subtle improvement this year is the slightly smaller screen borders. Making the 6.9 in screen look even bigger. It's an OLED display which we could normally show by the flame turning the pixels white, but there is no reaction to the heat this year. The flame definitely burns away the oleophobic coating, so I wouldn't recommend trying the flame test at home, but it's still pretty cool to see. I would also not recommend bend testing your own device. I am a professional after all. Lucky for Apple though, even with a substantial portion of the titanium frame removed to add that camera control button, the iPhone 16 Pro Max has hardly any flex. There are no cracks, creaks, or bends this time around. Much better than last year. Thumbs up for that. The iPhone 16 Pro Max survives my durability test. However, all that being said, iPhones do have the highest resale value of any smartphone, but not if it's scratched up or dinged. And as we've seen titanium is obviously still susceptible to damage. I always keep a dbrand grip case on my own phone. And this one has 
dbrand's new 3D printed topographical map of Area 51 that you can actually feel and hear. I've been using the dbrand grip case for years now. Usually with an x-ray or a tear down skin installed and it's kept my phone safe from all kinds of accidents. If you want the same protection for your own iPhone I'll leave a link down in the description. Subscribe to not miss the tear down and thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.","Apple is here again flaunting titanium on the new iPhone 16 Pro Max. At first glance it appears to be the same titanium exoskeleton design that we saw last year.

@ThisIsTechToday,Silver,CwaZ47RUjoU,AUDIO ENGINEER Reviews the APPLE AIRPODS 4,these are the new Apple airpods 4 with active noise cancellation an exciting pair of earbuds that feels like a cross between the airpods 3 and the airpods pro 2o the question is is it any good I'll share my thoughts from an audio engineer's perspective and help you determine if they're a good fit for you let's jump into it because this is Tech today the main difference between the airpods 4 and the airpods Pro 2 is the outer ear design the airpods Pro 2 has a silicone tip that rests inside the outer part of the ear canal Crea a passive seal this has various benefits regarding sound and a ANC like a more full and focus sound and passively cancelling sound from outside the seal the downside is that some people do not like having something in their ear like that so that's where the airpods 4 come in it's outer ear design rests outside the ear canal and shoot sound waves into your ears this can be more comfortable for some but it introduces the added problem of competing with the sound around you it also makes capturing reliable and consistent sound samples difficult so those won't be in this video it at least has an ip54 water and dust resistance rating compared to the airpods 3 its shape is supposed to be improved and more comfortable for more ear shapes and I can confidently say that is indeed the case for me I didn't realize how uncomfortable the airpods 3 was until I wore it next to the four the three has a bit more of a round bulb shape which creates pressure on the skull side of my ear because only a tiny surface area is pushing into it the four has a flatter shape which eliminates that discomfort in terms of how secure it feels I find myself still adjusting or feel like they're moving around while doing everyday things like walking around and washing my hands sitting still is okay most of the time but still I find that I'm often worrying about it falling out of my ears because I can feel it slowly slipping out and in some cases it does while the stems look similar to the airpods Pro 2 they do differ they only have pinch gestures rather than a combination of pinch and swipe gestures this is unfortunate as swipe gestures are a feature that adds a fantastic quality of life experience what it does carry over from the airpods Pro 2 is the ability to answer or deny calls and notifications with the head gesture however the airpods 4 uses Optical ear detection rather than skin detection like the airpods Pro 2 which means you might find it playing if it's laying down the right way or is in your pocket the most astounding thing though is the case itself is the smallest amongst the lineup it's so small and so cute but if you're the type that likes to use a lanyard there isn't an attachment for it on the case itself so you'll likely need to get a protective case for it like the one from Channel sponsor dbrand they also have a fantastic grip case for the iPhone 16 Pro Max to protect your phone and allows you to custom it that's great since Flagship tier phones like any color I personally love the leather skins if you'd like to purchase a case for your airpods or a grip case for your iPhone or other Android phone click the link in the description like the airpods Pro 2 the case also has a new speaker that helps you find it using various Chimes the front has a new cap passive button that replaces the physical button on the back and it's where the LED light is located and a few Taps allows you to enter into pairing mode one big downside of that small case is its lack of Mag safe support you can still wire wirelessly charge it but you cannot use those great Chargers that allow you to snap the earbuds case into place but you can charge it over USBC which they finally added to their keyboards and mice thank God unfortunately the battery life on the airpods 4 isn't that long with a ANC on you'll get 4 hours of listing time on one charge and up to 20 hours with the case which is likely limited due to its small size turning off ANC will give you an extra hour on a single charge and 10 hours more with the case in comparison the airpods Pro 2 has an additional hour on top of that with a single charge which lands it at 6 hours at 4 hours that would fall below the length of time for an average plane ride in the time in the airport unfortunately this is the time that you'd want to have a ANC on the nothing ear 2 also has this issue with battery life and neither is something that I'd use for travel because of this the airpods 4 supports Bluetooth 5.3 connects over Apple fast pair and has fine my capability the difference between the airpods Pro 2 and the airpods 4 is that the four uses Bluetooth connectivity and strength to locate them compared to the pros Ultra wideband Precision finding this means that it's a more generalized location finding which may result in you having a more difficult time finding them here's an interesting observation if you compare using the find my feature on the airpods Pro 2 and the airpods 4 the less precise form of find M on the airpods 4 uses a blue aesthetic while the excellent Ultra wideband version of the airpods Pro 2 uses a green aesthetic which is a bit backwards from the iMessage versus RCS SMS color scheme I just thought that was fun in terms of microphones here's how the three of them compare here is what the Apple airpods 3 would sound like if you were on a zoom call how do you think it sounds here is what the Apple airpods Pro 2 the USBC version would sound like on a zoom call how do you think it sounds here is what the new airpods 4 would sound like if you're on a zoom call how does it compare to the others let me know in the comments now cool thing with iPhone now is that you can record the calls so we'll get like a really accurate representation of what it sounds like through a phone call and this has been the airpods 3 in a quiet room this is what the airpods Pro 2 would sound like in a quiet room by the way this is all happening through an HD phone call as well and now we're listening to the new airpods 4 and a quiet room how well is it comparing against the others this is what the airpods 3 would sound like in a very noisy simulated Cafe environment here's what the airpod simul and this is what the airpods 4 would sound like in a very noisy simulated Cafe environment and this is what the airpods 3 would sound like in a simulated windy environment here is what the airpods Pro 2 would sound like in a simulated windy environment walls performing and this is what the airpods 4 would sound like in a simulated windy environment how well is it performing against the others well how do you think they each performed when I heard that there wasc on the airpods 4's outer ear design I was instantly skeptical Samsung had the Galaxy buds life which I was also wary of and it proved to be severely subar in terms of a ANC canceling audio out when you don't have a solid seal like the airpods Pro 2 can be challenging because you're physically letting in outside sounds it's much like defending against a charging Army but in a semiopen field there's a much wider opening for people to charge you at so an is more challenging in this form factor but unlike the Galaxy buds live the airpods 4 shockingly have way better ANC than I expected it's pretty good considering its open ear design but with some caveats using them on a plane and walking around the city lowered the overall volume significantly the most significant impact is within the mid-range but I still hear a lot of the high-end hissing of my surroundings the fit is critical here for the best performance as having it press in as far as it can go will help reduce the lowend Rumble if it happens to shift positions and barely slides out you'll hear the low-end rumble but the mid-range is still being reduced interestingly I'll hear a fluttering in and out of ansy with slight bits of mid-range popping through as there are little bumps while walking around is it because it's trying to figure out how to adjust to the added sounds or is it a change in fit from my body moving around I'm just I'm not really sure and that can be a little bit distracting or disorienting speaking of every movement even raising my eyebrows will cause the a ANC to stop performing as well with the highend breaking through since it often shuffles around when I'm moving around the ideal seal is usually broken in more active situations like walking around which is problematic forc performance it does seem like it's trying to cancel things much more aggressively than the airpods Pro 2 and that's likely because it's trying to work harder because of that I feel more cabin pressure or pressure on my eardrums either that or the pressure vents is less robust than on the airpods Pro 2 there is a transparency mode which is funny since it's an outer ear design and is inherently transparent however I will admit it adds some high-end back to the sound which would generally sound muffled when you would have earbuds in your ears compared to off this transparency mode is likely most beneficial when it automatically enables in conversation mode overall thec is shockingly good and the transparency is top tier like what you see on the airpods pro two I remember when I first listened to the airpods 3 I bought them assuming that they would sound bad it's an outer ear design so it sounds terrible I said there's no seal so getting a full sound is harder it's like trying to shoot sound into an open field instead of a narrow cave I experienced a lot of Humble Pie when I first listened to the airpods 3 somehow Apple made its outer ear sound good shockingly good for the outer ear segment and airpods 4 are the same they have a full sound with some solid lowend a forward mid-range and a high-end that avoids a dark dull sound it's not the best sound you can find but it sounds better than most outer ear design options out there and even some in ear options compared to the other airpods the airpods 3 has has more highend giving it more of the energy that I like in the ear gain region I prefer the airpods 3 more and I even find that the airpods Pro 2 has a bit of a darker dollar sound than all of them and I'm just surprised by that the downside of the airpods 3 is that you don't have a andc so you'll hear everything around you and this can make the listening experience less enjoyable and may encourage you to turn your volume up louder this is not good as hearing loss is becoming more pervasive and you only have one pair of ears protect them so you don't have issues for the rest of your life once you lose them you lose them and so I'm so glad apple is doing a lot to help in this area so is the airpods 4 for you here are some questions and considerations that might help you answer that question if you want an outer ear design earbud in the Apple ecosystem the airpods 4 is an excellent option if you want the most robust ANC option other options are better than the airpods 4 if you want an outer ear design with somec that actually does something the airpods 4 are shockingly good at this the airpods 4's batter life is only for hours which might be a deal breaker if you plan to use them while traveling they might be fine if you use them only around town at work or on trips especially when the case lasts up to 30 hours if you often lose your earbuds the generalized proximity version of fine M might be frustrating or not good enough for you if you want solid sound quality in an outer ear design the airpods 4 might be a good choice for you is the airpods 4 for me while the sound quality is a bit brighter which I like the overall package differs from what I want or need compared to the airpods Pro 2 I prefer an inear design for Better Sound isolation Inc I also travel a lot so I need a pair of earbuds that will last me around 6 hours per charge or more because of that if I'm looking for an option in the Apple ecosystem the airpods Pro 2 is my obvious choice the Precision find my capability is also a huge benefit and I use it all the time so are the airpods 4 for you or is there another option that you prefer let me know in the comments you also find a link to purchase the airpods 4 or the airpods Pro 2 in the link in the description or pin comment check out my other audio reviews here and my video filmed entirely on the iPhone 16 Pro Max here Apple did not sponsor this video and they have no editorial

@ThisIsTechToday,Silver,TJqTr8_w588,Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max: In-Depth Camera Review (Shot in South Korea),hey friend Brandon here from this is Tech today this is the iPhone 16 Pro Max actually that is the iPhone 16 Pro Max we're filming on it right now I'm going to Korea and I'm going to film as much of it as I possibly can on the iPhone so come along for the journey so neat little thing that I have set up here this is the stallman clamp right here and then we have an angel bird uh reader so this is all from Condor blue they sent this out to me thanks so much and that's making this whole Vlog possible so let's check it out see you later Cloud I love you yeah oh see you later Ruby girl I love you thank youate what makes this interesting is that it's not only my longest flight ever and oh by by the way here here's what the internet speed was on the flight it's much better when you're over land then over the ocean but anyways yeah this is my first time visiting South Korea first note about the iPhone 16 Pro Max changing photographic style seems buggy where the highlights will often blow out when you change the style is anyone else experiencing this I have been up for 24 hours straight and I'm so glad to finally be in my room all right until the morning and I'll tell you why I'm here [Music] all right time to get at it okay so you're probably wondering why am I in South Korea it's because I'm here with LG so we're going to check out a bunch of stuff I'll talk about that along the way this is also called the Twin Towers here for for LG and so this is their headquarters here but here we are using the iPhone camera on the the ultra wide lens we're going to explore a bunch of different observations using different programs for filming in log or not log so right now I'm filling in a app called Kino that burns in a l there's an option to do that this is the one from my friend Evan Schneider uh so what are you noticing here about the quality of the video and how it's exposing things uh I'll have some observations later on in the video about what I noticed any quirks about any of these apps compared to the normal built app and in terms of the microphones that I'm using at the moment it's the ones that are built into the phone itself now one of the things that I really like about the iPhone 16 Pro Max is that increased megapixel size on the ultra wide camera which makes it really great for you know vlogging and doing things like this you get way more of the shot it's a lot easier to film with I don't have to be so specific about my framing I'm probably in the frame now because it's an ultra wide so it's very exciting to have that [Music] and can you guess how many bridges do we have oh the one hour driving from so okay so today was very interesting um we we'll talk about this in a moment we found out that LG isn't just making appliances and now they're trying to go to other businesses to provide a turnkey solution for a factory I mean if you need a factory you probably are not an expert at it you don't know what to do so you go to another company like LG and ask for their help on how to make a factory so they pick a location that's efficient with your supply chain figure out the design efficiencies of that design including a whole bunch of robots like this it can move around it's autonomous it has a robot arm on there maybe some companies are going to start having LG factories the first meal we had was a classic Bogi bowl and it was wonderful one thing I noticed about South Korea were the sound barriers to cut down on traffic noise in some areas the top of it curves over the traffic which makes so much sense as it helps trap and reflect more sound brilliant now if you want enjoy experiencing new places or working out but want to remain aware of your surroundings to stay connected and safe the sound core Arrow fit too with its open ear design is a great option it's also great if you don't like having things in your ear because it's extra comfortable with flexible four level rotatable ear hooks with gentle soft liquid silicone to get the most comfortable fit a double curve service to distribute pressure evenly which is very important as having only a couple of points can start to become uncomfortable oh and if you wear glasses these also work for them they also have a base Tri acoustic architecture that sound cor says adds thunderous bace and highres wireless audio with L support for high quality audio since you'll be wearing these for a long time they have up to 10 hours of battery life on a single charge or 42 hours with the case you can charge it wirelessly or fast charge it in 10 minutes to get 4 hours of playback time to learn more about the soundcore aett 2 check out the link in the description and thanks to soundcore for sponsoring this portion of the video now question do you notice a difference in the optical quality between the wide and Ultra wide we're on the ultra wide now and we're back on the 1X main camera of course on Ultra wide it's a lot easier in terms of framing cuz it it's just so wide uh on 1X you have to be a little bit more specific but do you notice anything about the depth of field between the two let me know one thing I'll say is that I still think the main that lens has the best image quality and also has that nice depth of field that you'll notice but uh let me know what you notice okay so LG is known for a lot of things but did you know that they are also making EV Chargers here so they have a couple different versions here they have this smaller one that has uh a pullup stall for everything and then they have this bigger one right here with uh two plugs and that beautiful LG display here now this particular unit has ccs1 installed and I know what you're thinking if you're from North America yes there is an option to have nacs support if you choose to have that for your install so that is good to see because I mean it's it's better right it's better right okay right now we're using the main camera app because you're allowed to change the lenses while recording while Kino only lets you stay on one now here is 5X here is 1x here is 2X and then here is 5X on the log video setting so 5x 2X 1X and 5x I think the inside of the LG Twin Towers has a neat Vibe and look to it one of the areas we went to for dinner was high up in this massive building with a stunning view it was so high up that my ears would pop on the way up and down on the elevator look at this crazy view we had an incredible Korean meal where everything is served on one tray no one thing that Apple said that they improved were the lens flares and orbs on the iPhone 15 Pro Max but I noticed that it's still pretty bad which is unfortunate all right we're here in a traditional Market here in South Korea if You' watched the Netflix show street food here is the noodle lady here making stuff right now we'll get some really awesome shots on the iPhone 16 Pro Max using the Kino app on a bunch of different lenses to show how you can get something that looks really cinematic and awesome or like a documentary all from an iPhone 16 Pro Max something that's really cool about this area is that it's not very tusy it's trying to remain it like it's old school kind of Heritage I never really got the travel Munch growing up so it's really cool exploring new cultures and just seeing how they go about doing things markets like this have an incredible Vibe for taking photos in but what's still ruining it for me is this whole blowing out the highlights when you change your photographic Styles which I haven't been able to figure out the cause for because sometimes I'll go back to that photo days later and it's fine thankfully I did take this photo in the setting that I preferred and it just looks so cool and Vivy okay now we are here in the LG Innovation gallery and we'll be able to check out a few things normally you can't film or take photos in here but we're getting a chance to film a few things so come on throughout the trip I enjoyed filming with the iPhone as my main camera way more than I was expecting I think the footage looks really good the quality is now good enough and the convenience is just so compelling that it makes you not want to use a full-size camera as much but there are some different things that I can run into that are less than favorable like the shot right here with the bright ceiling light there in the kyot app it doesn't automatically adjust the exposure like you would have on the stock camera app and the down side is is the stock camera app just takes up so much storage compared to keyot or black magic and you don't have these amazing Luts or color grades that are burned into it that make it look really amazing something to keep in mind this is kind of an interesting thing uh LG has this and I guess it's a little bit common in other areas in Korea but you have mouthwash that you can have for your stinky breath it's kind of crazy how far smartphone cameras have come now only we can have faster charging that would be really convenient because recording video really drains your battery fast so make sure you have a battery bank I think the key thing to keep in mind is that if you want the ultimate convenience you should probably just use a stock camera app for everything in the non log or prores option but if you want the highest quality footage you should use log but you shouldn't use the main camera app because well it takes up so much storage yes you do have to deal with the whole inability to switch between camera lenses in the third party apps but I think the trade-off for being able to record longer is worth it and if you think professionals are going to use a real camera and not a smartphone for professional work well I mean almost everybody here was using a smartphone for professional work oh where's B so inside of uh this market area that's more traditional that's the Gold Star Market I believe is this kind of it feels like a secret little area that shows off of the history and a whole bunch of cool things about LG really crazy now we'll definitely have 120 frames per second test coming up soon which you won't want to miss but I'm really curious what are your thoughts on the quality of the video do you notice any differences between log and the default camera settings I'd love to know what you actually think in the comments the museum was really cool and this particular spot was really neat because it's where they handled repairs and they had a cabinet full of things made out of recycled plastic and for the Die Hard Nexus fans what phone is this I haven't seen one of these in a long time now after we checked out this little Museum we had some food and this is kind of crazy this is my first time I'm having these Wiggly Little Squid little tentacle things it's crazy see thank you that it's moving it's alive oh I'm always willing to try out something once it wasn't bad it tasted like Sesame we then made our way to a restaurant but on the way over there we saw that they were setting up this cool celebration here with this awesome stage here with an LED wall I also saw this Dad just dozing off while holding his kid and I just thought it was so cute I already missed the food from Korea it's surprisingly smaller portions than you would expect but oh so delicious and after lunch we walked over to one of the coolest parts of the whole trip all right here is a perfect opportunity to test out the audio mix feature here on the iPhone 16 Pro Max we're going through the different settings here and post and we're next to all this traffic over here so how well is it performing with all these cars driving fast so if you look over there there's a a really awesome uh Monument over there and uh the iPhone 16 Pro Max has this amazing feature called action mode it's just really hard to get a smooth shot when you're in telephoto to get close like that and so I just run it looks really shaky but afterwards when I check the image on it it's super smooth and I love using it but it's not available in third party apps like Kino or the Black Magic app so you have to use a native app now The Kino app does have stabilization built in but it's not going to be as robust as the stock camera app so that's something to keep in mind in noisy environments I don't think audio mix sounds that great what do you think so right now we're going to the palace and we had an opportunity to get these traditional garments to wear uh so it'll be a lot of fun I am the king I was trying to figure out what kind of color to work with and the person who was picking up stuff for me said uh a bunch of my choices were not very good so she picked up purple for me the architecture here is just unreal the detail and everything is absolutely beautiful but you know what time it is it's time for 120 frames per second test get ready when I step up in a place I make a shake yeah banging on my chest honey racks in the safe I don't want to talk we don't need a catch a case I don't want to flex but I'm in a different space when I walk up in a place better know I make a shake I make a shake hey nobody ever safe I make a shake when I walk up in the place better know I make a shake so there is an unfortunate reality about 4K 120 if you want to record in Pro res log you have to utilize the stock camera app and at that rate it will burn through over 120 GB of data in 4 minutes so crazy now despite Apple adding more cooling to the iPhone I still ran into heating issues which prevented me from using the phone as usual at times also check out these shots and notice the difference in color temperature for the photo what a fun trip I love these photos including these super out of place blue shoes with this outfit I really do hope that Apple opens up 120 frames per second and the ability to change lenses to third party apps that would alleviate a lot of the issues or friction that I ran into over this trip so the thing that I think is really crazy and cool is that they have the temple right there they preserve that historical Heritage in the building and architecture there and they have the city all around it they built around it but they retain that history and it's something I wish that we had more of in the United States cuz we used to have some really awesome buildings but we kind of tore it down to go for this kind of plain modern look so that's a bummer now one of the highlights of the iPhone is the photographic Styles and I actually really love it it adds an opportunity to provide a lot of Personality or taste to the photos that you want to take and the fact that you can adjust it in post is huge it's not burned into the photo why did you don't have that whole highlight overblown issue which I didn't have in this photo I found that I really prefer the gold style after our little trip to the temple we grabbed dinner and that was the end of the trip this trip was so amazing with some incredible people and I can't wait to go back to South Korea all right it's the end of the trip and I'm now leaving South Korea what a bummer but thanks so much to LG for bringing me out here and providing travel and accommodations for this trip they did not sponsor the video and they did not pay me for anything but we are now going going to another trip to Japan for the first time so let me know what you think about this video the video quality thoughts on the iPhone in the comments and thanks for watching this is Tech today until next time,hey friend Brandon here from this is Tech today this is the iPhone 16 Pro Max actually that is the iPhone 16 Pro Max we're filming on it right now I'm going to Korea and I'm going to film as much of it as I possibly can on the iPhone so come along for the journey so neat little thing that I have set up here this is the stallman clamp right here and

@ThisIsTechToday,Silver,ThmKbekcisg,AUDIO ENGINEER Reviews the Nothing Ear (Open) Headphones,these are the nothing ear open a $149 pair of earbuds with an open ear design and that iconic nothing design let's find out what they have to offer and whether or not they are for you from the perspective of an audio engineer that's me Brandon and this is Tech today the nothing ear open features an open ear style reminiscent of products like shocks but instead of bone conduction these rely on pure air conduction this means that you can listen to music while remaining aware of your surroundings it also allows you to chat without needing to pause your music if you want to control your music or anything else you can use the pinch controls on the earbuds themselves one downside of this open ear design is that you do not have active noise cancellation instead you have a sound seal system that is supposed to cancel out what you're listening to so that others don't hear as much of what you're listening to this is the first I've listened to of canceling the audio that others hear instead of what you hear from the outside world so interesting another downside is that this open ear design makes capturing reasonable and proper sound samples challenging so they will not be included in this video I know bummer comfort-wise the earbuds are tilted at a 50° angle for optimal fit and a three-point balancing system that supports them from the top front and back of your ear the ear hooks are made from a soft silicone like material providing a gentle hold they don't sit deeply in the ear canal instead they rest lightly on your earlobes and around the outer ear which makes them initially feel a bit unusual if you plan on using these for high-intensity workouts they tend to flop and move around a bit but they haven't fallen off in my testing perhaps they have a great secure fit but the movement makes me wonder whether or not they're going to fall off all the time it's just a little bit uncomfortable this L of security made it awkward for me in those situations but I feel comfortable using them while wearing them around the house the chargent case maintains the signature nothing aesthetic with its sleek and compact design it measures 19 mm thick and has a transparent lid while it is thin it does have a large footprint so it does feel rather large to me if you have rather large hands you can also use the indet to spin around like a fidget spinner remember those the case and earbuds have an IP for water and dust resistance rating are ailt to withstand a little bit of sweat the nothing ear open offers an impressive 8 hours of playback on a single charge with a total of 30 hours when you include the charging case a 10-minute charge over USBC on the case gives you about 2 hours of listening time interestingly my notes from nothing do not indicate wireless charging capability and I do not receive any sort of confirmation of it charging when I put it on to a wireless charger however if I were to keep it on a wireless charger for a while it would get pretty hot in the middle so it would make they have a wireless charging coil there maybe there is one there but it's just not active so I can't wait to see the tear Downs on this thing they utilize Bluetooth 5.3 for stable connectivity and can connect to two devices simultaneously if you misplace them the find my earbuds feature lets you play a loud sound to track them down this is not Precision finding so it's not compatible with the Google find my device Network it provides a low lag mode which offers less than 120 milliseconds latency for gaming this automatically enables when you enter into game mode on a nothing phone but you can manually toggle it on and off in the app on other Android and iOS devices chat GPT is another benefit if you use these on a supported nothing phone the nothing ear open comes equipped with two mics and an AI enhanced clear voice technology this technology is supposed to help reduce background noise and Echo providing crisp clear audio for calls the microphones were positioned to minimize wind noise in a windy environments so let's check out some objective samples to find out how they perform here's what the nothing ear would sound like if you're using them while on a zoom call here is what the nothing ear open would sound like in a normal quiet room here is what the nothing ear open would sound like in a simulated noisy Cafe environment how does it sound here is what the nothing ear open sounds like in a simulated windy environment how do you think it's performing oh this reminds me of Darth Vader oh RP James Earl Jones now let's talk about sound quality given the open design I was pleasantly surprised by the low-end performance while they rest outside the ear canal they still deliver a surprisingly decent Basse response pushing them deeper into the ear canal produces a more unbalanced sound profile with shouty Highs but a more pronounced low end The Sweet Spot is just outside the ear where they shine and where they naturally lay For Me overall the sound is crisp and clear and has a solid low end though some vocals may come off as slightly sibilant what's great is that they include basic and advanced EQ settings allowing you to tweak the sound to your liking unfortunately the issue of using the advanced EQ creating a drop in volume persists but you can always increase the volume with the volume rocker due to ear shape and the external open ear design sound perception can vary slightly from person to person what sounds good for me might not sound good to you essentially there are far more variables with a product like this so you should test it for yourself and you should test out any earbud or headphone before purchasing but more so in this case along with that concern I'm uncertain of whether or not I will provide a custom EQ for channel members as there's a good chance it won't translate well I'll have to think about that overall the sound quality is much better than most options in the ear earbud space this avoids the traps to having too much base minimal base only thin in siblin or too dark it's not as good as the nothing ear 2024 or ear a but it's much closer to those two than not and that's fantastic in my opinion so is the nothing ear open for you here are some questions and considerations to help you determine that if you do not like the feeling of having earbuds in your ear canal the open might be for you if you want a more secure fit where things aren't moving around as much the open might not be for you if you want to have more situational awareness the open is great for that the open is not for you if you want active noise cancellation to block out your surroundings if you want really long battery life per charge the open shines if you want the highest level of sound quality the open might not be for you so where do you land let me know where and why in the comments so is there nothing ear open for me while I appreciate the open ear design and how good they sound compared to its peers in this form factor it's not what I'm looking for in an earbud I much prefer the nothing ear 2024 it has a better fit in my ear the SC quality is amongst the best best and audio file approved and it has the benefits of ANC and more I have a whole review in comparison to the nothing ear 2024 nothing ear a and nothing ear 2 you should check it out up here but what I prefer or need May differ from yours and that's fine if the nothing ear open is something

@ThisIsTechToday,Silver,ciR9HfGTlf0,AUDIO ENGINEER REACTS: Apple AirPods 4 and Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max Sound Tests,"all right we have the brand new Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max in natural titanium and desert titanium as well as the airpods 4 that we're going to unbox get some First Impressions and some audio tests on the speakers let's check it out so the desert titanium is the new color in the lineup this year reminds me a little bit of the uh gold one that they had before we don't have a lot of colors right now in the Pro lineup so that's kind of a bummer so we have natural a little bit cleaner than I was expecting and then here has a little bit of a a pink Hue to it so it's not as brown as I was expecting it to be I kind of wish it was a little bit more saturated or darker brown but not like as brown as some of the links were like suggesting you know what I mean inside you do not get the Apple sticker anymore apparently you can go to an Apple store and get those but you just have your braided USBC cables here there's not a Sim injector tool on this one because in the United States we only have eim what's neat is that these now support 25 5 watt wireless charging previously it was 15 watts but in order to get that 25 watts you have to get a new mag safe charger so that's a little bit of a bummer but at least it's faster than before additionally there are rumors that these support 45 wat fast charging or faster charging but that's a bit in dispute but before it was a little bit slow at 25 watts so hopefully that 45 watts is correct because man uh when you're traveling and on a rush you know you kind of need to charge real quick sometimes so here I have my 15 Pro Max here and blue like the color here and uh supposedly these are a little bit bigger than it oh my goodness it is a little bit bigger and the Finish looks different it it looks a little bit more matte finish kind of like softer looking the size being just a slight bit bigger on the screen is comes from the fact that they reduced the amount of bezel on it now they say that this does have the second generation of ceramic Shield which means it shouldn't scratch as easily but glass still scratches and the one thing that I saw in marquez's video that just like cringed for me is that he held up the phones together with the camera array against the screen man I've scratched so many phones that way and I'll like put it on the table and move it around and then I'll look at it and there's a bunch of scratches on it somehow and the table looks clean I don't know what's going on with that so I always put on a tempered glass screen protector right away so I'm going to use one from Taurus their Glasco X the whole goal for Taurus is to help make your iPhone last longer it has a really neat little tool here that you just kind of set up and it's supposed to be a two-step process so let's try it out let's see if I can do this without following the instructions it seems like it might be pretty easy the Glasco X screen protector is easy to install in twostep it has 100% of coverage and goes all the way up to the borders it has up to 12 ft of drop protection and is scratch resistant Taurus also has some cases called the oan 360 spin in Dune Ivory and Onyx these are some good colors here but obviously I'm going to pick the Dune color for the desert titanium it just looks like it works so well so not only does it protect the cameras nice and well but it has that really great cutout there for the camera control it has mag safe support so you can use your accessories just fine it has a nice grip to it as well with a little bevels right there and the coolest part is you have this little kickstand built into it you should get the whole setup there there are links Down Below in the description there's even a coupon code available for those of you who are watching thanks so much to Taurus for that and let me know what color you're going to get thanks so much to Taurus for sponsoring this portion of the video so while they reduced the bezel on it they also made the phone itself just a little bit bigger and the question is does it feel bigger than the 15 Pro Max cu the 15 Pro Max already felt pretty big to me does feel a little bit bigger I I don't really like that I was kind of hoping it wasn't the case personally I would prefer the non-max now that it has the same camera array sensors just like on the max model so if you were concerned about it being too big on the 15 Pro Max then I would say this this is going to push it just a little bit over the edge I think it feels pretty pretty big to me it's crazy what like a millimeter will do now looking really close at this yeah you can definitely see those bezels got really thin in comparison that's kind of impressive so the fact that they made this screen look so much bigger by only making the bezels thinner and just making the phone itself wider or bigger by like maybe a millimeter in terms of width is it's pretty impressive like now what's interesting is that this still only goes up to 2,000 knits of brightness but you can go down to as low as one knit now so you can go really low if you want to which is really great when you're inevitably Doom scrolling when you're trying to go to bed there's also Apple intelligence but it's not here now it's coming later so I I guess I can't really talk about that so I now this is the interesting part it's the camera control button well it's not the button I don't want to say a button I haven't pressed it yet ooh ooh so apparently if you just press down the button it opens up the camera that's a great animation and if you hold it down again it should start recording a video if you want to do that or if you just press it it'll take a photo and they have this really neat animation there moving it around and stuff now I have like some hesitations because you know you could just use the buttons that's on the screen potentially but it is kind of fun and I imagine that they're going to use this for more than just camera control they're going to use this for other things there's going to be third party apps that'll go into using this and it's going to become really cool what you can do with it especially because it's not just a button it's a camera control which means I guess swiping around and stuff and that that can do a lot another interesting thing is this whole photographic style that uh they're adding here and this is really unique to me because there are a lot of really great phones coming out right now from Vivo and xiaomi it has a lot of contrast and it's just very opinionated and looks artsy and beautiful well it seems like they're trying to appeal to people like me who like something that looks more like a traditional film camera compared to a smartphone camera so you have all these photographic styles that are a little bit different than before and one of the coolest things about it is that you can take photo on your phone and then after the fact go into those photographic Styles and choose the one that you want and adjust all the settings and things like that so it's nondestructive I'm really excited to use the camera now that I can kind of tune it after the fact now in terms of positioning this does make a lot of sense right here in portrait mode but I do find it just a little bit out of place in landscape mode like I I put my fingers naturally here so I'm kind of having to go over here as opposed to you know when you're doing this this would feel really awkward down here I I would say I don't know what do you think do you think it should have been lower I I think it's they're trying to split the difference here but uh it does feel like a little bit more of a reach now one thing it's hard to deny is that this being a touch control button that you can swipe on really makes me wish that this had Touch ID built into it as well because it would be awesome to have both face ID and touch ID built into this same phone cuz you never know I wonder if they could add something like that that would be really cool another thing that they've added is 4K 120 frames per second so for all those content creators that are watching all those Peter McKinnon videos and all this other stuff when you have the Cinematic be roll of coffee making you can do that on your iPhone now but let's be honest you can do a lot of things with your iPhone in terms of filming with it including log footage which is amazing I've filmed a whole bunch of stuff like for my videos in long and people haven't noticed and I have a video coming up where I'm filming it almost entirely on the iPhone so that'll be interesting make sure you stay tuned for that make sure to subscribe and hit that Bell icon another thing I'm really excited about is the studio quality mics supposedly you can just record in certain areas and it'll be able to change the way things sound depending on your environment whether or not has more background noise or not I'm very interested in testing that out and comparing it with something that is done in post- production cuz I have a feeling this is using just like some processing AI processing to do some noise isolation that'll be interesting one thing that I really appreciate though is this continuation of non-destructive like it with the photographic Styles in terms of the sound samples you're able to make adjustments after the fact but they're not burnt into the actual audio file which is amazing okay let's try a little bit of a speaker test comparing the 16 Pro Max and the 15 Pro Max and see if it's any [Applause] [Music] better okay wow okay I think it has a wider stereo spread crazy I think it might be louder and I think it might have a wider stereo spread it's pretty close but like I don't know it's enough to fool me where I think it's actually different but I don't know maybe it's a placebo I'll need to do some more scientific tests on these so I'll get back to you on that all right airpods four time it's just a little guy oh my gosh is there anything else in here not even stickers not not even a cable okay this is like cloth oh wow there's like cloth in here it's not just paper my goodness look at how tiny this thing is this is insanely small here is the airpods 3 for comparison and then the airpods pro teal now the downside with this is that you don't get the lanyard on the side that you have on the airpods Pro 2 you don't get mag safe charging you do have wireless charging but just doesn't lock in on a MAG safe charger but you do gain the little speaker in there that you have on the airpods Pro 2 which is really great because you can get the little chime there and it makes it a little bit easier to find your device or your your your buds if you lose them there's an interesting thing though in terms of find my capability this uh uses Bluetooth instead of ultra wide band so you don't get that really pinpoint precision feature or for finding that you have on the airpods pro to you just get a generalized finding over Bluetooth so not as ideal but it's good that it's still there another thing that you'll notice is there's no capacitive button on the back instead it's right here in the front and so if you I guess if you triple tap it or whatever then it it changes modes of course you have your fast pairing capability on the iPhone hi Ruby oh we got a little chime there using the little button or the speaker now that they say they have a new shape that is supposedly able to have a better fit than before so if we look at these oh yeah that is a little bit different oh it looks thinner do you see how much thinner it is and this uh part right here is is a little bit more narrow that's that's very interesting okay let's put in the old ones I want to see how they feel okay yeah I mean it's it's there it's there okay let's put in the new ones oh yeah that's much better cuz like What's Happening Here on the old one it feels like it's a little bit more bulbous and that bulbous I can feel it in you know bumping into my ear a bit more pretty sure this is yeah that's more flat can you see the difference one is a little bit more round and this is flat so that's making a notable difference uh even in my own ear so that's pretty cool what's interesting is that this has active noise cancellation on it so let's uh put it in and test out thec and see how well it is able to uh to block out some some uh noise oh huh this is actually doing something which is very very surprising it sounds like it's it's canceling out more of the low end and not so much of the highend because I can definitely hear the s's of my voice very clearly but uh I don't hear so much of the body that's interesting I'm going to go on a trip on a plane so I'm going to try it out and and see how how well it performs so there's going to be a full review for these as well coming up so stay tuned for that now the other thing that we need to test out is the sound quality so the real question is how much better are the airpods 4 compared to the airpods 3 so let's listen to the airpods 3 real quick yeah the one thing that really surprised me about the airpods 3 were was just how much base was there I was not expecting that uh so they're doing some some live algorithm measurements to adjust the EQ for your specific ear which is really cool so yeah definitely some some good low end on that now let's listen to the airpods 4 gosh that case is just so small okay yeah it's got whoa yeah the ANC is kicking and I can't hear my voice very well yeah the sound is is definitely good it has that low end to it they have a high end there it's not going to be the best out there there's plenty of earbuds I think that sound like way better but for an open ear design option that has active Moise cancellation this is pretty dang good I'm really surprised now the question is how does it sound next to the airpods Pro 2 huh the airpods Pro 2 seem like they have more lowend but also more like high lows or High uh low mids so it might seem a little bit more muddy which is interesting the airpods 4 seem like they have a little bit more clarity in the high-end okay I would say that the airpods 3 actually have the most high-end to them but the loan is a little bit more uh weighty on the airpods 4 and then overall the airpods Pro 2 have the most low end to it but the high end is a little bit more subdued in comparison so in terms of the sound if I going to be honest between all of them I would prefer the three because it has a little bit more that high end to it it's a little bit more clear I like a little more Airy sound to it but if you're looking for a pair of airpods that havec and do not go inside your ear canal airpods 4 might be pretty pretty legit to go for one thing that I also uh realize is that you don't have swipe controls here all you do have is pinch controls so that's where you get the pro the pro you get swipe gestures you have the lanyard thing on there you have the in ear design so better ANC you have the ultra wide band so you can have Precision finding as a whole there's a lot of similarities between the airpods 4 and airpods pro too so very interesting so those are my first impressions of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and natural titanium and desert titanium as well as the Apple airpods 4 with your thoughts and observations would you want me to cover and check out especially for the earbuds and sounds and all that other stuff and uh the cameras Oh my gosh I'm excited to test that out so let me know you're interested in want me to check out in the comments if you like to pick these up go ahead and click on the links Down Below in the

@ThisIsTechToday,Silver,awY7eX8rguw,AUDIO ENGINEER Compares the ONEPLUS BUDS PRO 3 vs. Buds Pro 2,this is the OnePlus buds Pro 3 and OnePlus says it's the best audio device that they've ever created I want to compare it against the OnePlus buds Pro 2 to see how the OnePlus buds Pro 3 differs and has improved all from an audio engineer's perspective of nearly 20 years that's me Brandon OnePlus is sponsoring the Showcase my role in this video is to share the differences and features found on the new OnePlus buds Pro 3 and facilitate the test we'll start our objective test with a song sample throughout the video we'll have several of them to allow you to hear the sound differences between the generations this song is a mid-range full warm and Soulful track listen to her vocals the electric guitar lines and the [Music] keyboard you're my reason you're my peace the more I Brea in the I need my heart is is speed for slow and sweet I know you're the reason [Music] for the most obvious change with the OnePlus buds Pro 3 is its new case design instead of the ring boox design found in the prior Generations the orientation has changed to this fliptop design that is much easier to open with one hand the faux leather texture adds a helpful grip for that you'll also find a pairing button on the side and an LED on the the inside there are two colors mini Opus and lunar Radiance the earbuds have a few new changes first you'll notice that each earbud has an L or R to indicate which one it is a dinal label which we'll talk about later pinch gestures to handle your usual play pause call ANC modes and most importantly a new way to interact with it swipe controls and those pinch controls combined this is an excellent addition because you can easily adjust the volume levels with a swipe on either earbud which I love having on an earbud I also love having an ip50 five water and dust resistance rating for those sweaty workouts and the rain this next track reveals how each earbud handles the mid-range and some of the higher end such as the symbols and [Music] snares you know you're doing something to me what trying to do what trying to do hey hey baby hey hey [Music] the OnePlus buds Pro 3's battery life is up to 43 hours of playback time with the case andc off which is 4 hours longer than the buds Pro 2 withc on you get 6 hours on one charge in over 25 hours total and with a 10-minute charge you can get up to 5 hours of listening time it also supports wireless charging connectivity wise it supports Google Fast pair for quick connectivity and Bluetooth 5.4 for seamless switching between multiple devices and a solid connection across longer distances it also supports Google's find my network and for the audio files out there it supports lhdc 5.0 AAC and SBC for this next song pay attention to the clarity of the attack on the acoustic guitar strings but how forward that the mid-range is on the body of the guitar and the vocals I'm still falling [Music] out with you and I'm heading for the door not sure if I'll go [Music] through memories they take so long to we raise will they ever even start to [Music] fade I'm on my way one area that OnePlus said that they made notable improvements is in their ANC or active noise cancellation which has an extended range of frequencies that it will cancel out they also added an Adaptive noise cancellation feature that can reduce Sound by up to 50 DB what's unique about this is that adaptive a ANC makes it so that it's not only set to Max some people are more sensitive to a ANC so it can help with reducing discomfort it also helps with battery efficiency which results in longer re usable battery life if it doesn't need to be on Max but add a lighter touch to cancel out the sound it'll choose that instead along with that is a silent speech feature that enhances noise cancellation for voices OnePlus says that the buds Pro 3 has their best Android adaptive ANC experience so let's check out the objective test of both the anca and transparency modes to see how well it performs and how different it is from the buds Pro 2 this is what the OnePlus buds Pro 2 sound like in

this is what the oneus buds Pro 3 what did you notice about the results let me know in the comments here's another great song that covers a ton of the frequency range listen to how the high-end and mid-range changes between the buttons fall through the Flames don't knock my reckless ways with will be unbreakable unmistakable live in all time will world is waking up and the WF will taste no blood will be unbreakable [Music] unable in all time soon smoke going given how often we wear our earbuds we expect to use them for phone and video call notes and more the OnePlus buds Pro 3 has three built-in mics including a vpu or voice pickup bone sensor that sounds fancy to me let's hear how the mics sound and compare them in different scenarios here is what the OnePlus buds Pro 2 would sound

Pro three sound like in a simulated windy environment with the fan pointed directly at one of the earbuds how's it sound what were your observations let me know in the comments here is a cinematic track from my friend Hannah parrot that's fit for a movie soundtrack it's pretty epic with rhythmic drums and soaring strings [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] OnePlus says that the buds Pro 3 provides their best audio experience ever you've been able to listen to audio samples throughout this video to get an idea of its performance but what changes and improvements helped it achieve its sound the new OnePlus buds Pro 3 has dual drivers an 11 mm woofer for more power and a 6 mm tweeter for a fuller range of sound and higher frequency details the Tweeter is enhanced with a ceramic metal composite diaphragm and a flat voice coil and this is all designed to better reproduce the sound as the artist intended it even supports Google spatial audio technology so it's ready for Content that supports it splitting drivers into two can help provide more separation Clarity and control it's like having two chefs in a kitchen instead of one along with the two drivers are two dacks per earbud or four in total so one per driver OnePlus said that they added this to provide Superior audio quality and separate the task between the Tweeter and wolfer which helps achieve better sound quality and power management they stated that the benefit is that it prevents overlapping and potential interference now remember that Dino label on the earbuds in case well Danish audio expert Dino worked with OnePlus to tune the sound of the earbuds and within the app which is built into the Bluetooth settings on OnePlus devices or the hay Melody app on other smartphones there's a bunch of din AIO constructed EQ presets to choose from and even a custom EQ option which I love to see on every earbud as usual I do have custom eqs available for channel members let's listen to how my custom EQ compares to the default EQ this song has a lot of great Reverb listen to how forward the vocal sound the air from the vocal Reverb and how clean the lowend sounds and how the EQ affects the highend I need a I I need a bre Paradise I need [Music] if you'd like to discover more or purchase the new OnePlus buds pro3 check out the link in the description pin comment or scan the QR code here of course

@CreatedbyEllaYT,Silver,ZoTCq6zunl0,iPhone 16 PRO MAX Review With Apple Intelligence | Finally Great?,"the iPhone 16 Pro Max was pretty incomplete but now that Apple intelligence is finally here I tested it and everything else about the new iPhone there are many small changes in both hardware and software that add up to a pretty big update with the new camera button being honestly the least of it the new camera can produce some amazing results but it's becoming more complicated so I'll also show you how to get the most out of it but starting with apple intelligence the feature I was most excited for is summary in the mail app you can see the summary in the preview this tiny icon indicates that it's an AI generated summary and you can also Summarize each individual email with this button the summary also works in messages but you'll only see it in the preview and it works pretty well most of the time and I say most of the time because if I trusted it 100% then my dog would have been stranded you see the original message here is asking me if I can go pick up the dog instead but all I see in the summary is dog pickup rescheduled well thanks for rescheduling I guess I don't have to worry about it but aside from a few instances like that most other summaries are pretty reasonable as it is it can already save me some time but it could be so much more in the future since right now I don't really trust it fully and given that it's a smaller model that's supposed to run on the device itself it doesn't feel quite as smart as chat GPT missing some important details occasionally but I can definitely see this getting better in the future and becoming even more helpful and so is the new Siri it's super pretty with a new look and you can now type to it as well but the main Improvement is how smart it feels you can talk to it more casually and it can ignore the filler words but it's not that smart yet set two alarms for tomorrow morning one at 9:00 a.m. and another at 9:15 I think this is a pretty common use case but it only set one alarm here now onto the design of the iPhone 16 pros this desert titanium color kind of looks like sunset at the beach I like it and I also have an iPhone 16 Pro review unit here in white which is a slightly warmer shade of white than on the iPhone 14 pro Max here but yeah the matte titanium side still look great the biggest physical change is the display being bigger on both devices plus they got a Slimmer bezel so the overall size is still pretty similar to last gen and there's actually something new that's often overlooked when you slide the display brightness to minimum it can now go down to one knit so if you like using your phone in bed it actually makes a pretty obvious difference here next to the iPhone 15 Pro Max which only went down to 2 nits but if you're on an iPhone and find it too bright there's always the low light filter in accessibility besides that the display of the 16 Pros is pretty similar to last gen still topping out at 2,000 nits this rating is only for HDR content so most of the time it's not reaching this brightness but it's still comfortably bright enough for outdoor use however I wouldn't say these are the best displays on phones anymore because when outside or even in a brighter room the s24 ultra's display looks more contrasty and colorful since it has a much better anti-reflection coating on the iPhone 16 Pros they supposedly got a 50% stronger front glass but the coating is very much the same even as the 14 pro Max here and finally the new camera button that I'm honestly disappointed about nowadays I only use it to launch the camera app first of all look at this more professional camera every button is nice and tactile except for the shutter button this one feels more like a linear switch which makes perfect sense since you don't want the camera to shake right at the moment that you take the photo now look at me lining up the frame with this chart and then taking the photo using the camera button now the framing is just slightly off because the camera button is a physical button that needs a good amount of force to click down and take the photo there is a setting to adjust the firmness but you can't change the amount of force it takes to click down the physical button this only adjusts the amount of pressure needed to bring up the controls of course you can be super careful to not shake the phone but there's a big button right on the screen that would never cause this issue and same goes with switching between cameras and zooming just sliding on the screen does the same thing and you have way more room and it also feels more precise and not to mention if you're taking a vertical picture it's actually pretty inconvenient to use so the only interesting thing it can do is offer a shortcut to different filters and tone adjustment that would actually be interesting on the iPhone 15 but now on the iPhone 16s the filter and tone adjustment can all be adjusted retroactively in post and these filters and some other features I think do make this the best camera phone but only if you're willing to work with it let's talk about the camera Hardware first though there's this new thing called fusion and it does improve the processing you can see in this selfie on the 15 Pro Max the entire sky is clipped to white but the 16 Pro Max preserve the colors of the sky the ultra wide camera is definitely better with a new high-res sensor if you do put it to the high high resolution mode it's pretty obvious that it captures more details than before but even just in the regular mode it seems to have more dynamic range and the overall look by default is less contrasty and More in line with the main camera and an interesting note is that the main camera defaults to 24 megapixels but the ultra white still only takes 12 megapixel photos unless you specifically use the high-res mode the ultra white being better should also mean better macroe photos but I couldn't really tell a difference if you like the smaller Pro Models better this is the first year that the iPhone 16 Pro will also get the 5x camera and the 5x is definitely cooler It's Quickly becoming one of my favorite cameras to use just look at this 5x picture of me with the moon next to the 1X at the same spot it definitely looks impressive but this isn't the sharpest 5x camera I've seen both the s24 ultra and the pixel 9 Pro have a higher resolution 5x camera and do look a bit better the iPhones is not bad though even in low light the photo still looks good if you're not punching it however now when you take a 3X photo it'll just be cropping in on the main camera and it does look noticeably worse the main camera feels mostly the same except in the high resolution mode the new processing is a bit faster I press the shutter the moment I drop the apple and as you can see the new phone is definitely faster here but still not quite as responsive as the regular mode and the regular mode is great too I like how it defaults to a higher resolution 24 megapix photo and you can punch in 1.5 times while barely losing any quality and as for the color and the overall look of the photos well it doesn't make sense to talk about that anymore because with the 16 Pro Max there's so much more flexibility in post- production and I think this is where it really shines iPhones have had photography styles for a while now but they couldn't be adjusted in post so I rarely use them since the last thing that you want is to have a yellow filter on for a special moment and there's no one filter that's better for every single shot also when I'm taking photos there's just no time to be playing around with all the filters to see which one looks the best it makes way more sense to do that after taking the photo which the new phone can now do there's more adjustments to these filters too instead of tone and warmth you now have tone color and Palette here's how it works color adjusts how saturated the photo is and tone mostly adjusts contrast with less tone being more contrasty and the palette adjusts how strong the filter is that's why the standard mode has no palette adjustments and in this gold one turning up the palette Blends more of this golden hue into everything here's a tip I find that the photo almost always looks better when you reduce a little bit of the tone and increase the color so I leave it at -10 tone and plus 5 color in the standard mode now all of these filters can be adjusted in post including how blurry the background is in portrait mode so if you want to play with it you can almost always get better looking photos plus there's Pro raw which gives you even more flexibility in post but since all of this is just software it's a little bit weird that the iPhone 15 Pro Max is not getting any of the new filters as an update anyways Apple intelligence brings some new post-processing options as well this is the new cleanup you just scribble on whatever you want to remove the animation is really nice I have to say it'll then snap to the object and remove it pretty quickly the performance is very dependent on what you're trying to clean up if the environment is more natural and the cleanup area is small it generally does a good job like removing the random strangers cars and these trash cans in the background but if you're trying to remove a larger object you can see some artifacts like the obviously unnatural textures here and if you have a more artificial scene like this small trying to remove these people in the back it'll struggle more with trying to recreate the background or these table test scenes when I try to remove the tomato the AI imagin some new random thing here it kind of looks like some wrapper of some candy so there's definitely room for improvement but in this aspect it's already among the best I've seen both Samsung and Google's AI photo cleanup can suffer from these issues as well and the Apple 1 might just be the fastest however Samsung and Google's AI can also let you move objects around and extend the image when rotating aside from the cleanup you can also use apple intelligence to create a memory using a prompt I think this is really cool because before I would just have to wait for the phone to generate a memory and I actually like looking through those but now I can ask it to make one following a prompt and finally shooting video is still the strongest suit of the iPhone even just pointing and shooting it creates Adobe Vision HDR video that looks great on compatible devices and the new 4k 120 is also very cool it takes up a lot of storage but next to the 1080p 120 from the iPhone 15 Pro Max it does look much better but if you're willing to tweak the footage there's nothing that comes close to the iPhone because of prores and log the log footage has more dynamic range and it's easy to to match it to the look of footage from my real cameras look how similar they look here overall the iPhone's camera does feel the most Pro but you kind of have to be a pro for it to look its best anyways Apple seems to think that their intelligence features are just as important as their cameras so are the other AI features any good well they're smart reply and it's pretty useful if you get a lot of munding questions in email and text here I got two questions and just by selecting yes or no to these two prompts it generated a response that addressed both of the questions and if you read the response it does actually make sense realistically It's a Small Time save since it can't respond to more intricate questions and the proof free tool is helpful for catching spelling and grammar errors but I've never been a huge fan of the rewrites since they often sound a bit robotic and in this regard Apple isn't drastically ahead or behind the other on device rewrites I've seen though I would say chat GPT is still notably more natural sounding but I do enjoy the new summarize feature on Big Blocks of text that are not that important and you can even record and then summarize phone calls or anything else in the phone and notes app which could be useful for lectures lastly Siri is now much more useful as a text support for example if I ask it how to scan a QR code it'll show me the steps to do it using this phone whereas previously it'll just point me to some website that it found and all of these features feel pretty responsive to use the battery is around 5% bigger as well so I ran the same battery test for this phone and compared it to the iPhone 15 Pro Max's result when it ran the same test brand new it lasted 5 hours and and 54 minutes longer that sounds like a crazy margin but the difference in real life is a bit smaller when you're using data GPS and taking photos and frankly even the iPhone 15 Pro Max is more than enough for a day especially since I have some wireless charging pads I don't really even think about battery life speaking of which the new phones are also capable of 25 W fast charge on a wireless charger which is awesome but in practice it's pretty picky none of my wireless chargers can fast charge except the Apple One Plus you'll need a 30 W plus wall socket to get to that speed the performance of the new iPhones have also improved but the biggest question mark regarding the iPhone is its thermal throttling unlike almost all other phones which all gradually become slower as they heat up the iPhone's performance seems to just dive off of Cliff right after 1 minute and it still does that but just at a higher level being around 15% faster overall the smaller iPhone 16 Pro does throttle a bit more but it's very marginal so even though the thermal is not drastically improved it can still be a meaningful upgrade if whatever you were playing before was lagging over overall I really like the new update despite the Apple intelligence stuff feeling more like a work in progress with only some of the promis features in the first wave but I think it's fine since lots of the features are already helpful and if 5 years of OS updates also mean 5 years of Apple intelligence updates then it can be the beginning of something great as it is though it still has some of the best battery life and cameras especially if you're willing to tweak the filters for the best result all right that's it for this video shout out to my channel members thank you for the support and thank you all for watching bye",the iPhone 16 Pro Max was pretty incomplete but now that Apple intelligence is finally here I tested it and everything else about the new iPhone there are many small changes in both hardware and software that add up to a pretty big

@CreatedbyEllaYT,Silver,e_utOqzf5j0,"Finally, an OLED TV with THIS!! | Samsung S95D TV",I'm not sitting in front of a black void but this is actually the newest Flagship TV from Samsung and yeah this coding is really impressive there're barely any Reflections but this is far from the only cool feature of the new Samsung s95 D TV and by the way this thing can go all the way up to 77 in which is what I have right here and as someone who actually bought the previous generation of this TV when Samsung reach out to sponsored this video I was pretty excited to see what this new TV can do and see if it's worth it first of all the overall design of this TV is very Sleek it's only 0.4 in thick and the stand it comes with is also surprisingly small but it is very heavy and very sturdy I love this modern design with the super slim bezels but the most handy feature is the one connect box with this box you only need to run one cable to the TV and it provides a TV with power and signal I can see this being helpful if you're mounting to a wall but even just setting up like this the separate box makes Cable Management a lot easier and so much more convenient to plug and unplug things unlike with my older TV I don't have to dig underneath the TV to swap some cables this box has four HDMI ports with E and if you need it there's also ethernet and a digital audio output so you can always get highquality audio from your TV to an exteral Soundbar or any other audio setup going to the back of the TV the first thing you see are all the speakers This TV has a 4.2.2 Channel setup which means there are even speakers that bounce sound from the ceiling to give you a more 3D sound experience so even without a soundbar it supports DOL be OS and because I have the large 77in one it's super obvious when sounds are moving from left to right but what stood out to me the most about this TV is the coding Samsung calls it the OLED glare-free feature it's like a matte Coating in that it disperses a light hitting the TV but unlike a typical matte coating it has a super fine texture and it's not just about scattering the light this coating also does a good job at reducing the total amount of light that's reflected back I personally love this feature since most of the time I use my TV in a fairly bright room it makes such a big difference the dark part of the image remains dark which really helps the OLED panel shine also when you're looking at any image it's typically the sharp lines that grab your attention but this feature diffuses and blurs the reflection so there are no sharp lines and it's much less distracting you know that feeling when you're watching TV but you can kind of see people moving behind you I find that pretty distracting but with this TV I hardly notice those movements I think the OLED free feature really helps to improve the TV watching experience you don't need to be in a dark room for the content to pop even if you're just in your living room during the day the OLED and the special coating on top of it makes it such that everything still looks really vibrant and contrasty and of course since this TV is so large watching anything on it just looks incredible watching movies watching a sports game with a whole family it's just a great time and when the TV is off typical glossy TVs just look like a big black mirror which isn't that aesthetic the OLED glare-free feature also eliminates that and makes it kind of look like a smooth black wall another aspect lud is great for is gaming because it has such fast pixel response time plus the fact that this TV supports 144 Hertz gaming does feel great on it it feels super smooth and the large size of the TV makes it feel so immersive it also supports freesync premium Pro so if you have a source device that also supports it there will never be any tearing in the image that's when only parts of the screen gets refreshed with the next frame and so you see this noticeable split in the image freesync premium Pro ensures that the source and the TV are always in sync so that that doesn't happen I love playing games on here and if you happen to be playing games on a console that only outputs 1080p this TV can automatically upscale it to 4K with a new nq4 AI Gen 2 processor a complicated name but the result of it is clear the AI upscaling helps to sharpen up lower resolution videos and I haven't really noticed any visual artifacts the new processor also does a few more things like active voice amplifier Pro where it enhances the voice in your content so that you can hear it more clearly it can also do adaptive Sound Pro by using the processor's AI power to tune the sound based on your room and content so yeah the processor can utilize 20 AI neuron networks to accomplish these features and the mpu is four times faster than its predecessor the nq4 Gen 1 but actually this TV runs Tien OS and a pretty nice aspect of it is that you get access to lots of free content with tysen OS you also get Samsung TV plus which offers carefully curated entertainment at zero cost Samsung TV plus has plenty of live TV channels globally and thousands of movies and shows on demand Tyson OS also has many game streaming services built in like Xbox game pass so you can immediately get to gaming with just a controller you don't even need a console and if you use a Samsung phone there are some ecosystem benefits too like using Samsung Dex wirelessly on the TV you can also use a Samsung phone as a remote to control the TV this is actually super convenient because I'm always looking for the TV remote it just makes a lot of sense having the TV controls integrated with the phone and it works very fast and reliably but if you just want to use the regular remote it's surprisingly nice as well because it's Compact and has solar panels on the back so you would never have to worry about charging it another useful aspect of the ecosystem is smart things and that's built right into the TV too if you have Smart lights connected you can use the TV to turn on and off those lights overall my experience with tyen OS has been very smooth and I really do appreciate the additional features like multiv view especially for such a large TV if you ever fight over what to watch with your family you can just have both up now another aspect that received a pretty big upgrade is the image quality Samsung says that with the new OLED HDR Pro feature it's 20% brighter than before and the overall image quality is awesome even during the day with sun in the room I never felt that the TV is too dim and the colors look great as well I haven't tested this panel myself but it is Pantone validated for color accuracy and since it's an OLED panel there's never any blooming and it delivers infinite contrast on a pixel level and the colors on it are absolutely stunning right out of the box but there are many other modes too such that you can fine-tune it to the look that you like I like the filmmaker mode because it's super accurate and true to life but if that's not accurate enough for you there's also the expert mode where you can further adjust things like tint and contrast you can also select among four different color tones depending on how warm or cool you want the image to look and this whole thing is secure by nox security when it's transferring data with other devices the communication is all encrypted you can also expect updates that address the latest threats overall it's a great update especially for bright rooms I love the texture glass and the incredible size of it if you're interested you can check out the Samsung s95 D at the link down below thanks for watching,I'm not sitting in front of a black void but this is actually the newest Flagship TV from Samsung and yeah this coding is really impressive there're barely any Reflections but this is far from the only cool feature of the new Samsung s95 D TV and by the way this thing can go all the way up to 77 in which is what I have right here and as someone who actually bought the,0.0,0.9998,0.905
@CreatedbyEllaYT,Silver,FLrbO71yQUA,AMD’s New Processor is NOT What You Think | Lenovo Yoga Pro 7,amd's new processors are a pretty big generational Improvement but just getting the new processor doesn't mean you'll get all of the performance because different Power limits can really affect that so let's see what it's really like and how it Stacks up against the competition I got the latest Lenovo Yoga Pro 7 here and it's got all the power the processor can ask for Lenovo and AMD sponsored this video but the numbers don't lie when given the power the new AMD ryzen AI 9 365 can beat both the M3 in the MacBook Air and the Snapdragon X Elite in bench multi-core and it's also super close to those processors in single core performance however the typical drawback of x86 processors is efficiency amd's new zen5 architecture is meant to help improve that and from the numbers it really does in its Max performance mode the processor actually draws a similar amount of power as the X Elite arm processor but unlike the X Elite in the yoga slim 7x the new yoga Pro 7 is in the bigger Pro chassis and this chassis in last year's variant housed a dedicated GPU so there's plenty of cooling for the new processor even in the max performance mode it stays cool and the keyboard barely heats up a big part that helps with it is a new airfow design it pushes some of the air directly over the PCB that the processor and the ram sits on most laptops rely on just the heat pipes to cool this part but there's always some residual heat that's left over which really heats up the keyboard for a laptop that's this thin and light it has one of the coolest keyboards that I felt went under full load especially the center part and it does make doing heavier work like editing on it more comfortable but if you're using this laptop on battery the balance mode is where it really shines the processor's new architecture means that for the first time AMD has performance cores and efficiency cores and that does help with the overall efficiency and battery life in my testing of looping 4K YouTube videos it's 10% more efficient than last gen although it doesn't quite match the snap Dron X Elite in this regard but since the yoga Pro 7 has a massive 73w hour battery the battery life is still very good in my 4K video looping test where I had the screen at 80% brightness it can still last over 9 hours but the CPU and efficiency is only half the story the integrated GPU I think is a highlight of it being over 60% faster than the Snapdragon ex Elite and the performance Gap can be even wider in real life because of emulation overhead so it can actually play lots of games at 1080P and also do some graphically intense tasks like video editing but it's not really a replacement for discret GPU just yet also if your work can be accelerated by an mpu this processor has the fastest mpu in this class for those AI algorithms I personally don't have that much workload that can be helped with an mpu except for object tracking and D venci resolve but I could see it becoming more useful in the future now this laptop isn't just a new processor in a boring old chassis there are some pretty big upgrades as well like the new OLED screen it's very bright for a laptop at 600 nits while also being 120 HZ but the most impressive thing is that it covers 100% Adobe RGB and has a Delta e of less than one aside from the processor this is the biggest standout feature for me all of the content just looks amazing on it and the wide coverage and accuracy are both very useful for photo and video work but one drawback of OLED is the pixel shape the RGB pixel are often not these neat rectangle shaped like in an LCD screen and this can sometimes cause text fringing which means you can see some extra colors around the text but but this display is 2.8k that's pretty pixel dense for a 14.5 in screen so there's not really any discernable color fringing the only thing I wish could be a bit better is the coating it's a glossy screen and especially when I'm looking at a darker image I can see my reflection very clearly so it's like I'm just looking at myself another new thing is the coding on the keyboard it now has this soft touch finish and I think it feels really nice the yoga keyboard was already very good before but but this definitely makes it better it still has great travel at 1.5 mm and a little bit of a concave dish the keyboard deck is solid as well with very little flex and I do feel like this new coating helps to repel oil but perhaps the gray color also helps to hide it better and the rest of the chassis is pretty simple there's nothing too stand itish about it but you do get all the common ports that you'll need you get two USB C's one usba a headphone jack and an HDMI 2.1 Port so if you like to use a mouse house with a wireless receiver for lower latency like me you don't need anything extra and if you ever need to plug your computer into a TV or projector you also have the HDMI port right there I also like the rounded corners and edges so that it feels more comfortable in the hands and the hinge is also very taut overall the yoga Pro 7 has a very safe and practical design with a pretty potent processor the integrated GPU can get a surprising amount of gaming and creative work done it doesn't eliminate the need for dedicated gpus but this is a far more efficient package and the things that you look at and touch the most the screen and the keyboard are both great except for the trackpad which can be better by being a half tick one instead all right that's it for this video you can check out this computer at the link down below and thanks for watching,amd's new processors are a pretty big generational Improvement but just getting the new processor doesn't mean you'll get all of the performance because different Power limits can really affect that so let's see what it's really like and how it Stacks up against the competition I got the latest Lenovo Yoga Pro 7 here and it's got all the power the processor can ask for Lenovo and AMD sponsored this video but the numbers,0.0,0.9997,0.7776
@CreatedbyEllaYT,Silver,CUOzCh_Pcrg,SAMSUNG vs APPLE | Everything* Compared,"here I got all the latest products from Apple and Samsung in six major categories they compete in I'll be comparing their earbuds watches phones tablets and even laptops so let's see which one is better in each of these categories starting with the segment that I think just got the biggest shakeup which is the thin andite laptops the new Snapdragon X Elite arm processor really did change things for Samsung and with the new Galaxy book for Edge the laptop game just got much closer than before however it's not quite enough to be apple on its first try even though some of the benchmark numbers are very close the Snapdragon XLE only gets those scores on the best performance mode which is not that efficient and gets pretty bad battery life and it needs the best battery life mode to keep up with the M3 MacBook Air in terms of battery life but in this setting it's 28% slower than the MacBook Air and even in its best performance setting the GPU is still 33% slower than the M3 I have way more detailed testing in my previous windows on arm video but the gist is it's a huge step forward in terms of the battery life and efficiency for the window side even though it's not beating the M3 in the latest MacBook Air I think most would still be very happy with the amount of performance for daily use so performance aside let's talk about these laptops physically the MacBook Air is still a little thinner and I think the overall build quality is a bit higher it's more rigid overall with less keyboard deck Flex plus the book for Edge doesn't have a haptic trackpad even though many other Windows laptops already got it and the haptic trackpads are just so much nicer to use with even clicking force and feedback everywhere but the book for Edge does have some special Tri tricks such as an AMOLED touchscreen display it's 120 HZ but not particularly bright being about the same brightness as the LCD display in the MacBook Air and it might just be one of the only windows on arm laptops that has an actually decent anti-reflection coating but the MacBook Air has an awesome cating as well but aside from the display the M3 MacBook Air is a bit better in all the other aspects the build trackpad plus more performance and battery life I feel like Samsung could have put up a better fight since their Intel offerings has better chassis with bigger batter batteries and can be had as a twoin one so just drop this processor in there and there would been much more reason to get this over a Macbook but right now the MacBook Air is definitely the winner of this round so that's 01 to Apple now buds the new buds 3 and buds 3 Pro just got released and they look pretty similar to the latest airpods which means in terms of comfort and fit they're basically identical if one fits you well the other will work fine too and their controls are basically the same too for the pro lineup their feature set is actually super similar as well both have active noise cancelling transparency mode and this adaptive mode where it's a blend between the noise cancelling and transparency so when you're in a quiet room it'll basically be in transparency mode but as your environment gets louder such as stepping into a bus they would turn on more and more noise cancelling and the noise cancelling performance of the buds 3 Pro and the airpods pro is also surprisingly close they measure almost exactly the same I tried both of them in an Uber and I really couldn't say if one is doing a better job than the other and when it comes to the transparency mode I could definitely tell tell that the airpods pro second gen is better than the previous gen Galaxy buds 2 Pros but with the buds 3 Pro the transparency mode is now just as good other people's voices and my own voice sounds natural through them however the buzz 3 Pro do have a slight but audible hiss in its transparency mode as for the case design the buzz 3 Pro have a little transparent top and kind of looks like plants in a greenhouse also the top is actually flat so they can stand upside down the transparent part also showcases the lights that run down the stem of the buds the lights don't really do much they do look cool when you first open the case and if you're into the look you can pinch them to have them glowing in your ears but the airpods pro second gen has the more practical packaging the case is smaller and less thick the pods themselves are a little bit smaller too and somehow Apple also managed to squeeze in a pair of speakers in the case and this makes them easier to find for the Galaxy buds the case doesn't ring but the buds themselves can ring through the case and the lights do flash as well the slightly larger size of the bud3 pro is partially due to to having two speakers squeezed into each Bud having two speakers doesn't guarantee that the sound quality will be better I think the sound quality overall is pretty close between the two and it's pretty subjective which one you'd prefer the Galaxy buds has more bass and treble whereas the airpods are more vocal focused I personally prefer the sound of the Galaxy buds 3 Pro they're just a bit more exciting for Apple's earbuds lineup they've always had silicone ear tips for the Pro Line and no tips for the non-pro line Samsung used to have silicone tips for both their Pro and non-pro buds but this year they actually switch to be just like the airpods lineup so the buds 3 pro has the ear tips but the buds 3 don't now what's interesting is that the buzz 3 still has active noise cancelling which is better than nothing I don't have one here but I wouldn't get your hopes too high about their ANC abilities because not having a seal just naturally inhibits their ability to produce deep base overall I would say this category is a tie they're more similar than their different the sound quality fit noise cancelling and transparency are great on both the bu3 pros in interesting styling might not be worth the extra size of the case so both get half a point and that's 0.5 to 1.5 with apple in the lead as for the watch I have here the Apple Watch series 9 and the Galaxy watch 7 which was just refresh both come in two sizes the square shape of the Apple watch might let you see a bit more info compared to the round Galaxy watch since it doesn't cut off like a circle but either way is fine and some might prefer the more classic look of a round watch but the construction is more different than you think because if you go for the cheapest Apple watch with an aluminum rim like this one here it actually doesn't have a sapphire screen I think the sapphire screen is pretty necessary for a watch especially if you frequently bump into things the sapphire is harder than most metal so it won't scratch all the Galaxy watches have a sapphire screen whereas for the Apple watch you have to step up to the stainless steel model which is much more expensive to get the Sapphire screen but the other aspects are similar including the screen brightness at 2it Peak dust resistance and the exact same water resistance down to 50 m the Galaxy watch also o got a new 3 Nom processor and it also has a bigger battery it's about 6% bigger for the smaller watches and 38% bigger for the larger watches I have the two smaller versions and in an hour of workout tracking both lost 8% so they ended up being about the same as for the software both have quite a lot of watch face options just by default I love this Snoopy one on the Apple watch it changes every single time and you can add some shortcuts right onto the watch face for both of them the UI is slightly different but they have pretty much the same elements like you get the notifications and the widgets for both watches there are a lot of widget options but only the Galaxy watch has a earbuds controller which lets you toggle between the different modes like noise cancelling and adaptive oh yeah and for the Galaxy watch you can swipe around the bezel to quickly scroll through the widgets the Apple watch equivalent is scrolling the knob and both give a pretty satisfying haptic feedback but lots of people get a smartwatch to track workout and General Health metrics both can do a lot of that such as sleep tracking calories use heart rate blood oxygen and even ECG the Galaxy watch can do more though being now FDA approved to detect sleep apnea but what I find the most interesting is body composition there are sensors here on the side buttons and you just kind of do this to measure your body composition it's a nice way to keep track of your progress in the gym with these metrics you can tell if you're gaining muscle and losing fat even if total weight stays the same overall the Galaxy watch's Hardware is a better value with a sapphire screen and more sensors that allow for body composition measurement so 1.5 points the Samsung versus 1.5 for Apple now let's talk about the tablets specifically the Galaxy tap S9 Ultra and the newly refreshed iPad Pro with the M4 chip and the new iPad not only extended ex lead for performance but also took away the S9 ultra's only Advantage being the OLED display the S9 Ultra has a great OLED screen which did look better than the mini LEDs in the older iPad Pros since it has zero blooming but now the new M4 iPad Pro comes with a tandem OLED that's just as bright when watching content the S Ultra provides a much larger image mostly due to its aspect ratio but in terms of the quality they're very similar both have pure blacks and crazy highlights for HDR content also they're both 120 HZ and great for things like gaming and drawing and as for drawing there's a new Apple pencil Pro that can now roll and be found with fine by I'm not an artist but I am a pencil loser and can definitely make use of the fine my feature while the S Pen has a button the apple pencil Pro can now be squeezed with haptic feedback and tapped however there's still some aspects that I do like about the S9 Ultra namely decks I think the more computer-like desktop layout makes a lot of sense for a big tablet especially when plugged into a keyboard with trackpad and Stage manager in disregard just isn't quite as flexible and capable here on Dex I have five Windows opened and I can snap them by dragging them to the corners and they can also be freely resized and laid on top of each other but overall Samsung really needs to upgrade to keep up with apple the tab SN Ultra still has the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 profess processor which is slower than the hn3 in the s24su which kind of keeps up with the M3 which is a whole generation behind the M4 in the iPad Pro so yeah the performance is just not even close if you're into hardcore gaming on a tablet or some more professional apps an iPad is the way to go to be fair though the agent 2 is still very Snappy for typical tablet tasks like casual gaming watching movies and things like that and it's also fair to say that the M4 is kind of wasted on the IP Ad Pro you could render videos on it but you probably wouldn't want to because the software on the iPad just aren't as good as their computer counterparts both tablets are extremely thin with a big impressive screen but the iPad Pro is faster than most computers while the tap n Ultra is slower than my phone so Apple takes this one convincingly 1.5 to 2.5 now onto their Flagship phones Apple has two sizes for their Flagship while Samsung just has a bigger size if you want the best camera but in a smaller phone I gu this Apple's the only one that offers it with the iPhone 15 Pro but actually the smaller one only gets 3x for its telephoto camera while the 15 Pro Max here gets 5x and I really like the 5x camera it makes the camera set more diverse and lets me get these cool portrait shots or just use it to see far away signs Samsung's Ultra phone used to have a 10x camera but this year they decided to drop it for highres 5x camera which I think is better overall since it provides a more consistent coverage but because the s24 ultra's 5x sensor is 50 maps at 10x it still looks better than the iPhone the railing here looks a bit more detailed but the difference isn't that big of course the s24 ultra and the iPhone 15 Pro Max also have an ultra wide selfie and Main camera but the s24 ultra actually has one extra camera a 3X telephoto it's good quality but nothing too special it does beat punching in three times with the iPhone's main camera though and as for their main cameras the s24 ultra has 200 megapixels while the 15 Pro Max has 48 megapixels here are some photos side by side the biggest difference isn't the resolution but actually the colors with the Samsung being less contrasty and more saturated the technical aspects are really close both are very detailed in the 50 megapix mode and the Samsung's 200 megapixel mode doesn't really make it better while being much larger in file size moving on to the design both phones have titanium sides now with a matte glass back so they're more similar than different with the exception being the s24 ultra has a pen the displays on them are both great with the s24 ultra being a little brighter on paper reaching 2600 nits Peak versus 2,000 nits for the iPhone but in real life the difference is very marginal both with HDR content and just using them in sunlight but there's definitely still a winner here and that's the Samsung because it's anti-reflection coating is just straight up magical when outside or just in any room with a decent amount of light the Samsung is easier to see and the content on it looks like it has better contrast I think that's pretty obvious here with them side by side when it comes to battery life Flagship Samsung phones and iPhones used to always be pretty close but this year the difference is kind of crazy the s24 ultra has a 133% larger battery and in my mixed use case test starting from 100% with 1 hour of gaming and then video looping until they die the S14 Ultra lasted over an hour longer than the iPhone 15 Pro Max of course the difference might be bigger or smaller depending on how you use it but you can see the entire test here for performance this is the first time that the Samsung is faster at least for some of the things the CPU is about 16% faster while the CPU performance is trailing just a little bit behind in reality especially since I'm not a hardcore mobile gamer both feel very fast overall the s24 ultra just has better Hardware with a much better anti-reflection coating an extra camera and not to mention it also has a pen inside all that while keeping up and surpassing the iPhone in terms of battery life and performance sometimes so one more point to Samsung and 2.5 points tied now for the phones that are just one tier below the flagships the iPhone 15 versus s24 I feel like for the non-pro iPhone Apple really held out on a lot of nice features such as a 12 HZ display and they don't even get a telephoto camera at least the main camera is updated this year and has 48 megapixels it's a great camera that can kind of double as a 2X telephoto but the problem is the s24 also has a high resolution main camera while also giving you a 3X telephoto at the same price point the iPhone 15 does have an OLED display that's just as bright as a pro at 2000 nits but it's still only a fixed 60 HZ not only does it feel way less smooth but it also means no always on display the s24 display is slightly brighter 120 HZ and can also have a fully colored always on display like the pro iPhone and the ultra with a good-looking wallpaper it almost feels like Decor sitting there I like it and it doesn't even stop there while the s24 gets the same processor as a flagship the iPhone 15 gets a cutdown version of the last Gen processor making it much slower this has got to be one of the most convincing wins for Samsung and I do like the s24 more than the iPhone 15 in basically every aspect I really think it's time Apple stop holding the nice things to be only for the pro lineup there's just no reason why you wouldn't enjoy a 120hz display even if you're not a pro so Samsung takes a 3.5 to 2.5 points lead but here's a bonus round there are many product categories that only one of the companies make that I think are fun such as Samsung with their folding phones and now a smart ring it's like an alternative to the smart watch for health tracking and the two folding phones are on their sixth generation now and have become pretty refined the crease is definitely lessened but it's still there I think folding phones are cool and do have their unique benefits like using the main camera for selfies on the Z flip or basically having a mini tablet in your pocket with the fold you can even use it with a pen but Apple probably has the most staring product The Vision Pro I did test it out it is very cool and well executed especially for Gen one the image through it is incredibly sharp but it's just not very useful right now also pretty heavy on the face and very expensive so although Apple has some dominant wins in laptop and tablets when it comes to the other devices Samsung at least in terms of the hardware is just as good if not better so it takes the overall win but that's not considering lots of the software features and things like the ecosystem check out these videos to see which ecosystem you would prefer",here I got all the latest products from Apple and Samsung in six major categories they compete in I'll be comparing their earbuds watches phones tablets and even laptops so let's see which one is better in each of these categories starting with the segment that I think just got the biggest shakeup which is the thin andite laptops the new Snapdragon X Elite arm processor really did change things for Samsung and with the,0.0,0.9999,0.3182
@CreatedbyEllaYT,Silver,ulXeKHtePDI,Galaxy Z FLIP 6 Review | More Than Just CUTE Now,"this is the new Z flip 6 the flip form factor has always carried a lot of compromises when compared to its conventional counterpart but this year they addressed a lot of it like with much better cameras and bigger batteries it still isn't perfect but the zlip 6 is even more fun with its new software and after living with it for 2 weeks I find the form factor to have some benefits Beyond just being cute and nostalgic starting with the design this is definitely my favorite Z flip the back glass hinge and sides all became matte even the bezel around the main screen which was glossy before is now also matte I love the new texture it doesn't track fingerprints nearly as much and it looks great another notable change is the hinge it definitely feels more firm and satisfying now on the last gen Z flip 5 when fully opened it's actually not perfectly flat you can see a slight Bend here the new hinge improves on that and the zflip 6 opens almost completely flat I say almost because there's still just a little bit of wiggle room when you push on the hinge like this however the new hinge didn't actually give it any more dust resistance it's now officially rated for IP 48 but that's actually only against solid objects bigger than 1 mm only a rating of Ip 5 something would be considered dust protected and also when you first boot up the phone it does tell you that it's not dust resistant but the main compromise of folding phones is having a crease right in the middle of the screen the new hinge does actually help with this if I run my finger on it side by side against the Z flip 5 it's a noticeably shallower Valley on the new phone and sometimes you can even see that it's less steep especially with these Reflections here but the thing is anything besides a perfectly flat screen is is visually noticeable when you can see any sort of reflection you can tell that the screen is obviously creased but when there are no Reflections or if the screen is bright enough to mask all the reflections then the crease becomes almost not noticeable and actually the screen became much brighter this year picking at 2600 nits it's just as bright as the s24 ultra of course this helps with outdoor visibility but it also helps to mask the crease better than before the anti reflection coating is also surprisingly good for a folding phone with a built-in screen protector layer it's as good as it is on the smaller s24 but it's no match for the s24 ultra which has this super dark coating to be fair though I haven't seen anything else with such a good coating the other aspects of the Z flip 6 screen are also very competitive being 120 HZ and OLED and if you haven't used the flip before you'll be surprised by how tall it is it's as tall as the s24 ultra but about the same width as the smaller s24 so the Z flip 6 still feels easy to hold even if you have smaller hands but when browsing the web it feels like a larger phone and you can easily swipe up to get two still very usable halves by splitting the screen vertically however a regular 16x9 video doesn't look bigger than on the smaller s24 only Ultra wide movies make use of this wider aspect ratio effectively besides that I do like the speakers being a slit now as opposed to tiny holes but I'm not sure about the color matched rings around the cameras they kind of look like Wally's eyes also the zlip 6 is practically the same thickness as last gen but given that the battery increased from 3700 m hours to 4,000 and it now also has a vapor chamber it's honestly an achievement that it's not any thicker another cork of Samsung's folding phones is that they don't have an underd display fingerprint scanner it's still on the power button but it's very quick and accurate so you can unlock the phone even before flipping it open but the change I'm most excited about are the cameras it's a night and day difference compared to the last generation and it really starts with a software look at these photos side by side on the phone themselves the one on the zflip 6 just pops out so much more it looks like the same effect you get when you start playing an HDR video the highlights in the photo taken on the zflip 6 uses the entire brightness capability of the Ola display which makes it really look like it's popping off of the screen previously when you looked at a photo side by side on a Samsung and iPhone the iPhone photos tended to look more impressive since they were already using this trick but now the Samsung photos look just as impressive on the phone on the hardware front the selfie camera stayed the same which is the one phone where I'm completely not concerned because you're probably only going to use that for video calls there are phones with much better selfie cameras out there here's the iPhone 15 Pro Max and here's the s24 ultra selfies but none of them gets even close to the quality of the zfp 6's main camera the main camera is a much bigger sensor with higher resolution and a better lens even though the s24 ultra has one of the best selfie cameras I think the results here speak for themselves so if you want the best photos of yourself this is the best phone to do it with you can use a highquality main camera or even the ultra wide and frame up your shots with the cover screen preview and in this case the form factor comes in handy too you can set the Z flip down anywhere and prop it up at any angle the software is pretty helpful too you can show Palm to have it take a photo so if you're the type of person who would turn a regular phone around to try to get a nicer picture of yourself you would love this also if you like vlogging this makes for a really compact setup with good stabilization and actually you can launch the camera directly from the cover screen and here you can adjust the megapixel and aspect ratio as well as set a timer it's also very easy to zoom in and out and you can swipe with between the regular photo video or portrait mode however the cover screen preview is still only available in the native camera app I think it can become even more useful if third-party apps were to support it too so you can film higher quality Tik toks right in the app now the zflip 5 actually had most of these form factor and software benefits too but it was the hardware that really held it back this year the zflip 6 received a new 50 megapixel main camera and it's quite a big Improvement it's not just higher resolution but it's also a physically bigger sensor and you can see the effect of it here in this shot I have the new zflip 6 and the zflip 5 side by side focused on me and the background in the zflip 6 photo is just a little bit more blurry and it does look nicer at night the larger sensor can gather more light so it's less noisy and it does look marginally better even ignoring the high-r capability of the new camera and just leaving it in the regular mode so 12 megapixels which is probably how most people will use it the quality is still noticably better than last year if you look at this the grass here is a little bit more detailed but the main difference comes in terms terms of the dynamic range in this shot of me you can see on the Z flip 5 my shirt is just completely clipped to Black while some of the detail is still preserved on the zflip 6 and this is very similar to that of the s24 I'm glad that the main camera is finally on par with the S Series putting it to the 50 megapix mode does give you an even more detailed photo next to the 12 megapixel on the zflip 5 it's a pretty obvious difference the other benefit of the high resolution main camera is zooming in there's still no dedicated telephoto on the Z flip so all of the zooming is done by the main camera at 2x the photo still looks really good and much better than on the Z flip 5 and take a look at the 3x photo next to the optical 3x camera on the s24 I'm pretty sure they developed some new processing algorithm for these zoomed in shots the cropped in 3x zoom on the zflip 6 seems to have less noise and the overall texture looks pretty clean and detailed this is surprisingly close to the dedicated telephoto on the s24 But ultimately it does lack some resolution the text here is still pretty readable on the s24 but it just looks like some weird AI drawing on the Z flip 6 and here's what the Z flip 5 looks like zooming in 3x yeah the new Z flip is so much better at this some of the Improvement carries over to video as well it has better dynamic range which does mean it consistently takes better looking videos but unlike the s24 which it shares the same processor and sensor with the zflip 6 cannot shoot 8K videos as for vlogging with it I don't have much complaint about the stabilization I can walk around and the footage is still smooth but actually I later realized that holding the Z flip like this isn't the best for taking horizontal video because the sensor is vertical when you're filming like this it's cropping in on a vertical image so it's lower quality and the field of view is smaller instead you should turn the flip sideways and then adjust the aspect ratio I also tried the autof framing feature and I think with the 50 megapixel main camera it's more useful now than last year since you can zoom in and still get decent quality but it's still not the most reliable unlike the main camera the ultra white stay the same and that's a bit disappointing it still looks pretty okay but it's now really lagging behind phones like the s24 Mostly because of its lack of ability to focus with the s24 is ultrawide not only is the ultra white sensor bigger but you can also use it to take macro mode pictures if you get too close to your subject with the ultra white on the zflip 6 it will be straight up blurry as you can see here next to the s24 that's a shame but this only becomes a problem when you get really close even with a fixed Focus everything is in Focus starting at around half an arms length away so if you want to Vlog with the ultra wide your face will still be in Focus Beyond just the viewfinder there's a lot more to the cover screen it's exactly the same size resolution and shape as last gen but it has more lock screens and widgets now so it's more fun and a bit more useful I really like these interactive cover screens it almost feels like a snow globe the Emojis move around as you tote the phone and you can also make them bounce around this one is so cute but unfortunately right now there are only five presets of this and you cannot customize anything about it also why would they put broccoli in 40% of these who wants bouncing broccoli on their cover screen Samsung is known for customization so it's really weird that you cannot adjust anything even changing the background color would be much nicer but at least for these and for all other kinds of wallpapers you can change the clock style add the battery percentage which I think should just be enabled by default and even change the shortcut to be a different app or go to a specific widget besides that you do get lots of options for the cover screen wallpaper the frames are pretty cool the subject pops out of them there're also these informative ones that let you add some widgets right onto the cover screen and this year there's a new photo ambient wallpaper you can choose your own photo and then it will apply time and weather effects to it based on your local time and weather that's pretty cool I also like these animated flower ones they tick like a clock I think they would look so cool as an always on display but unlike on the s24 where you can have a dim wallpaper as he always on display you can only have a clock on a black screen on the Z flip this is most likely because the cover screen doesn't have adaptive refresh rate so lighting up more pixels would cost way more battery as for widgets there's still aren't that many options it just doesn't seem like many third party apps are supporting it but the ones that are there are nice like Spotify starting a timer checking off some reminders and if you have Galaxy buds the buds manager one is great too and I'm glad that now you can group multiple ones into one page also for faster navigation between all of the widgets you can just pinch out to see all of them and then jump to the one that you want by default the cover screen also supports a few apps and by a few I mean very few if you want to run any app on the cover screen there's a fairly easy way to to do so just by downloading goodlock multistar which is still made by Samsung since the cover screen is so short though there's not really a point in doing that for most apps it's just so much better using it on the bigger main screen i di like 50% faster in crossy roads on the cover screen and some third party apps just break on here but for things that only take one to two steps it can be helpful to do them right on the cover screen like responding to some text messages and there's even AI suggested replies now it's also nice being able to toggle between ring and Silent on the cover screen but I do wish I can customize a quick settings just like on the main screen so that I can like turn on my hot spot right from the cover screen overall I've been using the cover screen more and I can feel that it's only 60 HZ but that's not a big deal however I do wish that it's as bright as the main screen because when Under the Sun it can be a little hard to see and as for the rest of the software it's a bit of a mix bag between great features I use all the time and gimmicky AI stuff that feels like a solution looking for a problem one customization trick that I love is setting different combinations of lock screen home screen and cover screen using modes and routines here if I toggle on my custom mode I can change all my wallpapers instantly and there are a few new AI features they're currently only available on the new flip and fold but they're probably going to go to other Samsung devices fairly soon the new portrait studio is fun for 2 minutes you try it on your friends and family once and then forget about it part of this is because it only stylizes your face as opposed to the entire image the other new thing is sketch to image and I think it's a great idea but I feel like the ai's performance is not quite there yet the stuff it generates often doesn't blend well into the photo and sometimes it's unintentionally comical so the new AI features are somewhat underwhelming but overall Samsung's AI features do add value like now I can quickly summarize a web page and do some fixes to my photos with the generative edit something that's been notably missing on Z flips is Samsung Dex where you can plug into an external screen and have a more desktop-like experience the zflip 6 technically doesn't have decks like you can't find it anywhere on the phone but you can get new decks after toggling on Force desktop mode in developer options I went in and tried it and it's very similar to Classic decks but strangely there's no window snapping and the taskar for me seemed bugged with not showing my open apps if you really want to use decks I guess this is something the reason given for why Z flips never had decks is due to Thermal limitations but given the new processor and the vapor chamber there's really no reason that the zflip 6 can't have decks because even in the thermal limited State it's at least as fast as the s23 ultra in most cases and that had decks the zli 6 has the Snapdragon 8 gen 3 in every market and also a bigger Vapor chamber than the s23 ultra but in reality it can only do so much in comparison the s24 which has the same processor and a vapor chamber that spans the entire height of the phone is much more effective at dissipating heat the vapor chamber in the zflip 6 is only in the top half of the phone and there's just no way to effectively move Heat heat from one half of the hinge to the other so ultimately in this 20-minute gaming Benchmark you can see that the performance of the Z flip just drops off of a cliff much faster than the s24 and at the end of the 20-minute test it's only performing about 80% as well however this is still a pretty big upgrade over the last generation since the new processor is just so much faster and you also get 12 gigs of RAM with the zflip 6 so even though the 8 gen 3 can't reach its full potential inside the zflip 6 it still somewhat keeps up with the last gener Flagship the s23 ultra and the s23 ultra is by no means bad at gaming now so neither is the zflip 6 although it's kind of weird having only one of your hands heat up overall it's a fairly good gaming experience you get this Ultra widecreen feel another way Samsung eliminated the flip phone compromise is with the battery capacity it's now 4,000 Mah hours the same as the s24 I tested it by looping YouTube videos and after 2 and 1/2 hours the s24 is at 85% while the Z flip 6 is at 83% so basically the same maybe the Z Flip's bigger display is using a tiny bit more battery and in the gaming Benchmark it consume less battery mostly because it's thermal throttling more overall it's great that Samsung eliminated lots of the drawbacks with a foldable phone the battery life is hardly a concern now and the difference between using the main camera versus a selfie camera is huge if you like selfies and Vlogs this is probably the best phone for it the software is super customizable which is fun but for lots of people it probably comes down to the crease it's better but definitely not invisible if half of you watching this subscribes I'll give away a new zflip 6",this is the new Z flip 6 the flip form factor has always carried a lot of compromises when compared to its conventional counterpart but this year they addressed a lot of it like with much better cameras and bigger batteries it still isn't perfect but the zlip 6 is even more fun with its new software and after living with it for 2 weeks I find the form factor to have some benefits

@ChigzTech,Silver,2VK_awDJ_ss,"Powerful BuzzTV Powerstation 6 - Android TV, RK3588, 8GB + 128GB - Any Good?",what's up guys today I've got my hands on the Buzz TV power station 6 roll the [Music] intro okay so quick look at what you get inside the box your paperwork is in digital form so you just scan the QR code for user manuals we have an HDMI cable power cable this comes with a power supply and it's like a small laptop power supply I'll give you a closeup of the voltage information now we have a bag of port covers and each one is labeled so you can see that one says USB and this one here is for the HDMI port we got two AA batteries Energizer brand so very decent batteries included for the remote control and here is the remote so this is a hybrid Bluetooth and infrared remote in one it's got buil-in microphone for your voice searches and you've got a lot of functions on there so full featured remote control you can see you've got guide button record button so this TV box does feature a VR and last but certainly not least the TV box itself so quite a powerful TV box let me just quickly run you through the specs so it's powered by The Rock Chip RK 3599 so you've got an a72 dual core and an a53 quad core combined in one coherent system the result is supposed to be High Energy Efficiency and high performance so that is what you can expect from this box and I can't wait to put it to the test now for Ram you have a choice between 8 or 16 gigs of ddr4 RAM for storage we have 128 GB emmc storage built in this box does feature nvme SSD expansion up to 2 TB you've got Wi-Fi 6 with dual antennas built in you've got a gigabit Ethernet port features Android 13 with Buzz TVs unique UI on top you've got PVR and time shift functions this box supports HDMI 2.1 supports up to 8K at 60 HZ and does also support HDR 10 plus and av1 codex so design-wise this box looks like a beast it looks like something made by Razer or Nvidia it's quite big and uh bulky in size on the back there is a compartment if you open it you will see a section where you can attach your nvme SSD so you're basically sticking in your drive like so and then you're seating it and you just TW twist so you can close that compartment now I've just connected up a 1 TB drive so we now have 1 TB of internal storage which is insane for ports on the front of the Box you will see USB 3 USB 2 a type-c port and a physical power button there is nothing on this side and there is nothing on this side either and on the back you've got power socket micro SD expansion as well we've got Optical out HDMI 2.1 and a gigb ethernet port so brand new design brand new chipset let's go ahead and get this all connected up and find out what this monster can do I'll be right back now first of all I ran a bootup speed test and this TV box took 23 seconds to fully load to the home screen from a cold start so this is full Android 13 with Buzz TV 6 UI on top now this interface is designed with Internet TV in mind so you have your live TV your VOD your TV series EPG guide uh PVR recording function and so on and so forth so once you connect your internet TV package to the the UI um then you get a really nice clean interface now just underneath you have your app section with all your favorite apps all in one line right at the top you have subheadings so you got home my channels my VOD and then you got your app section showing you all the apps that installed on this box as standard so quite a few apps to get you started including Disney plus you got YouTube and You' got the Google Play Store and this is the Android TV version of the App Store so you're limited to Android TV apps but you can of course still Sid load any of your favorite Android apks now if we head over to the main system settings go to device preferences and check out the system storage info now this box has 32 gigs of internal storage from which 113 gigs are free to use now if we go back and have a quick looking about you will see that this box is apparently running Android TV OS version 13 and you have more info on the security patch kernel and build numbers Etc got decode and bitstream if you click on it you can see information on audio device pass through HDMI is already selected and here are the audio formats that are supported via pass through under display and sound if we check out resolution it is set to automatic you can see 4K 60 is supported and you do have HDMI CC control here are your HDR options so it's on automatic but you can have HDR or SDR on all the time we've got Buzz TV utilities as well so if I'll give you a quick look at that now under Buzz TV utilities you have system update you have home screen weather settings remote control options volume control Network shares and and the light bar can be customized so at the moment the light bar can be switched on or off so you can switch the remote control backlight on and off as required the pointer speed can be adjusted and the color keys can be mapped so the color buttons can be customized or mapped so we can have the red one to open any app we like so the red button should really open YouTube that's how I like it and so on so forth now there is no native option for screen mirroring but you can of course go to the Play Store and download air screen and that will at least give you screen mirroring for your iOS devices but unfortunately mirror clast or Android screen mirroring is not an option natively okay so now it's time to play some 4K video samples from USB drive and I'm going to be doing this with the VLC player which I just downloaded so let's begin with the usual hbit TR jellyfish demo the first video video is 160 megabits per second and you can see it's playing quite effortlessly nice and smooth and test out the 180 megabit per second high bitrate jellyfish demo and you can see this is also running nice and smooth and finally the real test 400 megabits per second High bit rate jellyfish sample and you can see it's actually playing back okay with no stuttering or buffering issues pretty decent performance from this box with the ability to play back high bit rate 4K thereafter I tested out a bunch of 4K 60 videos with various HDR formats and they all played back beautifully with no issues vibrant colors and great looking HDR and while we're here we may as well test out the av1 codc to see if it works and it worked absolutely fine so av1 codak also supported so let's move on to the 4K YouTube test so I'm pleased to confirm that YouTube does support 4K 60 but unfortunately HDR is not [Music] [Applause] available we will experience no major national breakdowns [Applause] [Music] [Music] they're usually prisoners of War I tried installing Netflix from the Play Store it was available I installed it but every time you open up Netflix you get this error so unfortunately Netflix is not supported and you would have to sideload an older version of Netflix to get it working but then you will be limited to SD quality next up we tested Amazon Prime video and it was available to download from the Play Store and it does support HD streaming which is certainly a good okay so thereafter we tested out Disney plus and I can confirm Disney plus does support HD streaming with 5.1 suround South okay moving on to the gaming test and we're just going to test out some basic games starting off with crossy roads [Music] for you Advanced users DRM info shows Google wide Vine level one and here is Ada 64 where you can check out the clock speeds and you can see this indeed is running the Mali g610 so that brings us to our benchmarks beginning with geekbench single core score of 687 and multicore score of 2293 and in the anti-d do benchmark test we have have achieved 687k so let's see how that compares with the others so here is my top Android TV box performance chart for 2024 showing you the latest TV boxes and seeing how they compare with each other and the ranking is based on anti2 benchmark scores and based on that you can see the Buzz TV power station 6 takes position two with a decent Benchmark score of 687k and I've also given this box an overall rating of four out of five so from this chart you can see the perform performance scores and my overall rating all color coded to make it easier for you to read now you can view the full versions of all my charts online at Chi tech.com and read them at your leisure so there you have it guys that was the Buzz TV power station 6 and here are my thoughts now I really like the design and build quality specifications are also pretty good the design and performance is very good Wi-Fi and ethernet is super fast 4K 60 with HDR from USB plays very well streaming is pretty good no buffering or Shing issues Disney and Prime both support HD streaming games played very well and the Bluetooth remote is also very responsive now the caveat to consider no native screen mirroring Netflix is limited to SD quality after side loading also there is no doubt this is an expensive streaming box and it may not be everyone's cup of tea but on the plus side this offers a solid Internet TV experience with their custom software and PVR and time shift functions and the SSD compartment is also great to have now if you if you want to see more of my latest and greatest unbias tech reviews hit the like button sub to the channel and hit the

intro okay so quick look at what you get inside the box your paperwork is in digital form so you just scan the QR code for user manuals we have an HDMI cable power cable this comes with a power supply

@ChigzTech,Silver,4wHkhxit_sU,MIND BLOWING MacBook Pro M4 Speed Test Results! - Massive Upgrades!,"what's up guys an exciting box has just landed on my desk so today I'm quite excited to unbox the latest MacBook Pro 2024 version with the new M4 processor roll the [Music] intro so without any further Ado let's get right to it just going to cut it from the top I already knew it's going to be a box inside a box second box wow check it out guys you have to open two boxes until you get the main Apple box MacBook Pro I am so excited to get this open let me quickly tell you guys since 2017 I've been using this MacBook Pro it's the 17 touch bar model it's running the core i5 with 8 gigs of RAM and 256 storage so it's actually served me really well last 7 years I literally run my channel on this MacBook Pro but it does now feel slow and laggy when trying to edit 4K videos it can still handle it but you have to be patient as you work with lag so it takes longer to edit those videos that you guys have been watching and following on this channel so old MacBook Pro is now being upgraded to the new 2024 MacBook Pro at the back there when I'm in the office I do edit with the M2 Mac Mini so when I need a bit of a performance boost that is what I use otherwise this has been my main daily driver 7 years later here we are my second ever MacBook Pro so we've opened two boxes I finally reached the main MacBook Pro box and as expected the main box is all white with the image of the product on top and it says MacBook Pro on the sides just going to rip the tab that's one and that's two now we can get this baby open oh man so here it is guys my first interaction with the MacBook Pro 2024 yeah I can't contain the excitement wow you just touch the MacBook and you know what quality is well the Apple logo looks a lot bigger so straight away wow rounded edges this feels different let me just tell you quickly what else you get in the box so we got a high quality braided mag safe 3 charger so USBC to mag safe 3 interesting and you do get a power brick now I wasn't sure if this was going to come with a power supply so so I'm actually happy that they have included one and you can see it's a 70 W USBC power adapter so in that fancy box that is all you get and of course you do get some paperwork as well so here it is guys the new 2024 MacBook Pro in space black and first impression this is so damn beautiful so this is the base model of the MacBook Pro and it costs 1,599 now if we talk design having used space gray for so many years um space black is a nice refreshing change I'm also noticing the size difference the new Macbook Pro is 1 cmet bigger in length and width but the thickness is actually nearly the same now for ports on the right side we have a full-size HDMI port which supports 4K display output then we have a single type-c Thunderbolt 4 which supports up to 8K display out and can also be used for charging and then we have a full-size s DXE memory card slot so that's all the ports on this side if we check out the other side you got the mag safe 3 charging port you have two more Thunderbolt 4S and a headphone jack so compared to my old MacBook which only had four Thunderbolt 3 ports and a headphone jack and nothing else the extra ports are certainly nice to have so just want to compare a few things as well along with size you can see the Apple logo is slightly bigger and if we flip this thing over you will notice that the rubber feet circles are also uh nearly double in size and they do seem to protrude out a little bit more so we've got the same ventilation on the left side and you have that same vent on the back but the vent does does appear to be a lot bigger than the old model so that's uh interesting all right let's open this up for the first time yes let's remove this cover cuz we don't need it so as soon as I powered on connected to Wi-Fi it's immediately doing a Mac OS update so while it's busy doing that let's talk about the keyboard so the keyboard is back lit and you got nice decent Siz keys and a large trackpad to go with it now there is a power button in the top Corner which also has built-in Touch ID sensor which is really good as I'm quite used to logging in with Touch ID so I'm glad that is still an option now one of the most exciting upgrades is the display my old MacBook Pro has a 13.3 in 60hz Retina Display with 500 of peak brightness the new Beast comes with a bigger 14.2 in liquid Retina xdr Display supporting 120 HZ adaptive refresh 1 million to1 Dynamic contrast and up to 1,600 nits of peak brightness and of course a much higher resolution of 3024 by 1964 and not only that this display also supports Doby Vision HDR 10 plus and hlg compared to what I was using this is an absolute AB dream come true now the power and performance is also on another level the old MacBook Pro is powered by the Intel Core i5 which is only a dual core clocked at 3.1 GHz and this also has 8 gigs of lpddr3 RAM and a 256 gig SSD and the new Macbook Pro is powered by a monster chipset it's Apple's new M4 running on 10 cores and 10 threads clocked at 3.9 GHz along with 16 gigs of RAM and 512 gig SSD so massively upgraded chipset and double the RAM and storage that is what I call an upgrade now I do lose the touch bar but in 7 years I have barely used it only for volume control and maybe brightness apart from that that I did not find that touch bar very useful so I'm certainly not going to miss it in the new model but at least we do have the touch ID sensor that was important so no doubt the screen is absolutely gorgeous to look at now even if we compare the bezels the bezels are tiny and the FaceTime camera is also upgraded from a 720p to a 1080P and 12 megap photos and you do have that camera cutout following the design of the iPhone so really slick really beautiful looking screen now both screens are on maximum brightness and I just can't believe how beautifully sharp uh and bright this new Macbook Pro looks all right so for those of you who like benchmarks let's compare the benchmarks of both MacBooks so starting off with geekbench 6 ready 1 2 3 three so they're both running at the same time let's see how quick the new Macbook Pro is all right so the new Macbook finished its geekbench test it took around 3 minutes and 45 seconds and you can see the results there but we will compare the results in a bit and 6 minutes and 51 seconds later so we're nearly reaching the 7 Minute Mark and we have not completed the test in the older Macbook so both have completed the geekbench six tests 3 minutes 45 seconds in the new Macbook Pro the old MacBook Pro took 7 minutes 59 seconds so basically 8 minutes and we compare the results so single core score 1084 and multicore score of 2319 and the new Macbook 3833 and 1 1560 massive performance boost according to geekbench okay so now we're running a cine bench on both now I press start at the same time and the new Macbook Pro start the test straight away whereas the older MacBook Pro took a few moments to begin the test old MacBook Pro 866 points single core and the new Macbook Pro 2,212 points single core okay I am now running the multi-core test but while that's running let's just check out the results for the single core so you can see that Apple M4 is doing better than most core i7s and if we check out the older MacBook results you can see it's performing pretty bad cinebench multicore results so old MacBook Pro 2,173 and the new one is 13,870 and quick look at the multicore chart you can see the Apple M4 is ranked at position four just above the core I9 impressive stuff okay so the results for the dis speed test the new Macbook Pro right speeds of 3 4 68 versus 1300 and read speeds of 2994 versus 1342 okay so quick look at the multimedia capabilities of this MacBook Pro so for example this is Netflix and you can see Dolby vision is supported so you can indeed watch your favorite Netflix shows in Dolby Vision even though he's a little pipsqueak he ignited the fire in me and I'm just checking out YouTube streaming because that's something I do a lot of so YouTube does support streaming at 4K 60 HZ with [Music] HDR so new feature that I've not seen in my old MacBook so this is new to me is uh mirroring your iPhone so your iPhone needs to be just docked in the background you're not supposed to be using it and it will mirror your iPhone screen so you got two shortcut buttons there one is to take you back back to homepage and the other one is a recent button you can basically swipe left swipe right and open any function of your iPhone that you want I just want to try playing one of my own videos so let's just play what's up guys going to pause that there so you can mirror your phone and you can have both landscape and portrait views depending on how much desk space you need and at the same time you can be browsing the web so the screen mirroring feature is really neat so there you have it guys my first look video of the new 2024 MacBook Pro powered by Apple and for my first impressions are really good my expectations were quite high but I'm not disappointed at all the design and build quality is super premium I do like the rounded edges and how they feel and absolutely loving space black color the display is absolutely Next Level compared to what I was using the screen is bigger has a higher resolution faster refresh rate and has a much higher Peak brightness as a bonus this does support Dolby Vision HDR 10 plus and hlg G chipset is very good performance is outstanding editing videos is now much quicker no lag at all so editing 4K or even pror is much much faster on this I couldn't even edit pror on that old laptop so editing exporting everything is much quicker on this machine for me this is an absolute productivity booster now I did not upgrade all these years as I was waiting for something special something more complete as a pro model and this year's 2024 MacBook Pro is exactly that the design the connectivity the performance it was hard for me to ignore this upgrade so it's a done deal this is my new daily driver and I'm going to use this for everything if you have an older MacBook Pro model and you're thinking about upgrading this is the one people now with all of that being said I will leave the links in the description box so you guys can check this out for yourself meanwhile if you want to see more of my latest and greatest unbi tech reviews hit the like button sub to the Channel and hit the Bell icon thank you so much for watching and I catch you all in the next one peace [Music]",what's up guys an exciting box has just landed on my desk so today I'm quite excited to unbox the latest MacBook Pro 2024 version with the new M4 processor roll the [Music] intro so without any further Ado let's get right to it just going to cut it from the top I already knew it's going to be a box inside a box second box wow check it out guys you have to open,0.0,0.9998,0.8553
@ChigzTech,Silver,iXa5Bk0pu0w,Xiaomi Redmi Watch 5 Lite vs Active: Which ONE Should You Buy?,what's up guys so today I bring you a comparison video between two budget smart fitness watches both priced well under 50 and they are both made by the same brand so we have xiaomi's redmi watch 5 active versus the redmi watch 5 light roll the [Music] intro now the full specs are on screen right now for you to read so pause the video if you want to study the specs or let the games begin now this video has been created to help you see the main differences between these smart fitness watches and to help you decide which one to go for covering everything from the specs features strengths and weaknesses of each watch if I sound a little bit strange to you guys don't worry it is me still but unfortunately I'm not feeling too well so my throat is a little bit croaky but nevertheless The Show Must Go On now let's begin with the price redmi watch 5 active costs £29 99p and the redmi watch 5 light costs only 39 and 99p so only 101 difference between them so let's find out what that extra 10er gets you and also would you believe that both of these smart Fitters watches support Bluetooth calls so you can take the calls directly on the watches now Bluetooth calls at this price point is already quite remarkable so quite excited to share this comparison with you now first of all let's talk design both smart watches are made from a complete plastic watch case but they are both finished with a unique coating of metal around the sides to give it that metallic look and feel now the active model still looks pretty much like plastic the metal spray hasn't made a massive difference however the light model finished in in this chrome silver effect can actually be mistaken as a metal watch case as it feels just like metal so if if I did not read the specs on the official site I would say that this watch is made from metal so the light model does feel more premium in build quality even though they are technically supposed to be the same plastic watch cases now both watches feature a single button on the side which is your power button and doubles up as a home button as well on the other side we have nothing and underneath you will see your health sensors housed in the center and on top of both watches you will see two holes one is for a microphone and the other one is for loudspeaker so yes you can take Bluetooth calls directly on the watch and here is an example of the Bluetooth call feature in action hello how's it going hi how you doing yeah yeah uh I was just testing out this uh Bluetooth calls on a new smart Fitness Watch How does the call Quality sound it's okay SL my pH it sounds like a really distant call but yeah I can hear you you can hear exactly what I'm saying though yeah I can hear you all right that's good I'm going to call you back again with another one give me two minutes thank you okay bye bye bye hello hi hi can you hear me how's it going yeah good to yourself yeah good I'm just calling you from another smart Fitness watch um what's the call Quality like on this one it's better on this one better than the first one um yeah so I can hear you clearly and everything obviously it's the best of quality but yeah I can hear you that's good to hear thank you so much I'll catch up with you later on thanks a lot take care all right bye by bye so that was a very quick call Quality test so it seems like the light model sounded a bit clearer to the person on the other side which is quite interesting now both watches also feature 5 ATM water resistance but there's something to note here if you go to workouts and if you scroll down right at the bottom you'll see pool swimming on the light version and there is no mention of pool swimming in the active model if you then tap on more right at the top you got water spots in the light model where you've got even more swimming activities water activities that you can be tracked and there's a lot there and water sports does not exist anywhere in the active model so that means the active model is not going to track your swimming sessions but the light version can now wrist straps both watches come with remove removable silicon wrist straps and both are 24 mm in size and they both feature a quick release so you can replace them with any thirdparty 24 mm strap now the strap design however is quite different the active model has no traditional buckle and instead you just clip it on to your size and tuck away the rest inside the strap similar to the Apple watch basic strap now the light model has a more traditional style strap included although the Buckle is actually made from plastic but it's nice to know that you can swap these out with any 24 mm band so next up the displays both displays are actually quite different the active model features a 2in LCD display versus a 1.96 in AMOLED display and when we set them both to the same watch faces and the same maximum brightness you can visually see the difference the AMOLED display looks better much brighter and clearer resolution wise active model has 320x 385 resolution display with 250 pixels per inch versus the light model which has a 410x 52 resolution display and that's 332 pixels per inch so higher resolution and more pixels per inch now if we talk about always on display the active model does not support it at all there's no mention of it inside settings the light model does support always on display which is a good thing thing all right so performance- wise they are both running xiaomi hyper OS now there is no info on chipset or Ram or storage or anything like that but having used both extensively I can say that they are both equal in performance okay next up dimensions and weight the active model is 49.1 MM X 40.4 mm and it's 11.4 mm in thickness and weighs 43.9 G with the straps on the light model is 48.1 MM by 39 .2 mm and 10.6 mm in thickness and it weighs 42.5 G with the straps on so the light model is smaller Slimmer and it's also slightly lighter than the active model now I have tested both watches quite extensively both are quite comfortable to wear and they both look pretty good too both have large screens and feel very light on the wrist now I can't actually tell which one is lighter as they both feel equally light and comfortable on my wrist now in case you're wondering I have a wrist circumference of 7 in and both watches do look pretty big on my wrist but I didn't mind it at all considering how light these feel do let me know in the comments which one you think looks better on my wrist all right now let's talk Health sensors looking at the bottom of the watches we have our health sensors and they look pretty much identical both watches will give you heart rate spo2 automatic sleep tracking and you have an accelerometer the light version also has a gyroscope and GPS built in the active model has no gyroscope or GPS builtin and instead uses your phone for its location services now if we talk battery capacity on both watches is 470 Milah which promises up to 18 days of battery life and if you put it on Ultra battery saving mode you can get over 30 days of battery life charging pins are exactly the same on both watches and the charges are identical as well you get a usba charger with a magnetic connection which simply connects to the back of the watch like so and it takes around 80 minutes to fully charge both watches from 0 to 100% furthermore please note both watches do not have built-in Wi-Fi or NFC for Wireless payments now to my surprise both watches can be linked to Amazon Alexa and then you'll be able to use Alexa directly on the watch to tell you things like local weather tell you a joke and so on so forth now Alexa can't talk so any output you receive from Alexa will be read only all right now quick mention of the health features so they both support continuous 247 heart rate monitoring they both support automatic sleep monitoring including recording multiple sleep records day and night so just want to quickly share with you last night's sleep record so you can see 6 hours and 19 minutes on one of them if we scroll it will give you a breakdown of how it all went and you have features like Advanced monitoring and everything as well and you can monitor your sbo2 throughout the night they both support automatic workout detection you can take Bluetooth calls directly on the watch as I showed you earlier you have 24/7 stress monitoring and 24/7 spo2 monitoring they both have plenty of workouts built in to choose from neither watch features a temperature sensor built in so your temperature cannot be monitored with these watches okay so now I'm going to attempt to test out the health sensors against a medical grade sensor so this is the brawn oxymeter which you just wear on your finger and it's supposed to give you an accurate reading for your heart rate and your spo2 in in real time 98% spo2 and you can see my heart rate there 104 heart rate is going to be high because I'm not feeling well let's first of all do a three-way heart rate test if I get all of them open okay so we're measuring our heart rate on all three devices at the same time let's see what sort of results we get the actual heart rate is 107 right now we're measuring on both 10 two on one of them 98 versus 100 all three neck and neck now 101 103 105 the active model is giving us a slightly higher reading um okay now we're neck and neck again I'm actually quite impressed both watches are managing to keep up with the Brun oxymeter now let's do sbo2 now we're trying to get a reading on both watches at the same time and I'm trying to keep absolutely still okay still calculating but it says 99% on both at the moment 97 98 all right so we got 97 on one of them 98 on the other and the oxymeter says 96% okay we're going to run it once more to see if we can get a better result 96% on the right 99% on the left is still collaborating so now the light version is given us 96 and the active version is given us 99 so it looks like the redmy watch 5 light is slightly more accurate when reading your spo2 okay so what about compatibility with IOS and Android well both watches are compatible with any Android phone but also compatible with iPhones I've been using my iPhone 14 pro with both watches um and I've had no issues at all I've had no connection issues it stays connected and there are no syncing issues either now quick mention about the watch faces there are lots of watch faces to download on both watches you are spoiled for choice you can download them they are free watch faces to download but here here is the drawback you run out of storage space as soon as you download too many watch faces and how much is too many guys six so as soon as you have six watch faces installed on this system your storage will be full on both watches so you can't download anymore now until you delete a watch face unfortunately even though they haven't shared the storage info with us I can tell you right now we're talking megabytes so they haven't given us enough storage to be able to store more than six watch faces at any given time so that was the physical and specs compared but realistically which watch is better for you now here is how the look on my wrist again and if you're wondering I have a wrist circumference of 7 in and in terms of comfort they both feel great on my wrist the active does look a bit more plasticky SL budget in design whereas the light version looks more expensive than it actually is um and of course the light version offers a lot more features for only10 extra so for that 10 the redmi watch 5 light will give you a higher resolution AMOLED display with more pixels per inch you get an always on display along with built-in GPS and gyroscope you can also track your swimming sessions too so if you're are considering between these two watches to maybe save yourself10 I would say to you don't it's redmi watch 5 light all the way baby so that sums up my comparison video let me know your thoughts if you already picked one of these up let me know how you're getting on meanwhile if you want to see more of my latest and greatest bi tech reviews hit the like button sub to the channel and hit the Bell icon thank you so much for

@ChigzTech,Silver,yro-CI984mE,Testing the NEW Google TV Streamer 4K - Worth the Money?,what's up guys today I've got my hands on the new Google TV streamer [Music] 4K so this is Google's latest streaming device it's running official Google TV OS and supporting 4K streaming across the board including officially licensed Netflix 4K and supporting Dolby vision and Dolby Atmos so very excited to see how this one performs Inside the Box you will find a small user manual you get usba to type-c power cable a small power supply you get two AAA batteries for the remote control and this is a Bluetooth remote control a very similar design of this remote control that we've seen in the past for the previous Google streamers so you can you can see we've got a home button we've got the Google Assistant button so there is a built-in microphone and we have a dedicated YouTube and Netflix button and last but certainly not least the Google TV streamer itself so we have a brand new design over here price-wise you can pick this up right now for £99 and for that price you get some pretty interesting specs let's quickly run through them so this device is powered by mediatech Mt 8696 quad core clocked at 1.8 GHz for Ram we have 4 gigs of RAM and 32 gigs of storage we've got 5 GHz Wi-Fi AC Bluetooth 5.1 and this has a gigabit Ethernet port this is running official Google tvos version 14 you've got the Google assistant and chomecast built in supports HDMI 2.1 and supports 4K HDR at 60 FPS along with Dolby Vision HDR 10 plus hlg Dolby Atmos and Dolby Digital plus you do get a small bluetooth remote included and Google promises 5 years of security updates so Clos look at the design you can see this looks very different to the previous chomecast streamers now for ports we have a power indicator we've got a small round button I'm assuming it's a power button you got type-c port for power a gigabit Ethernet port and an HDMI 2.1 and that is pretty much all your ports now there's only a single USBC Port there's no other ports to plug in any of your Hardware but this does support USBC hubs so first of all I ran a bootup speed test and you can see on screen exactly how long it took to boot up from a cold start and you can see this box is running the official version of Google TV and it's the latest version Google tv14 on the top you have your subheadings for you movies TV shows apps and Library okay at the top you do have subheadings for you movies TV shows apps where you can download more apps and Library if we head over to the main system settings this TV box does in fact have 32 gigs of internal storage from which 23 gigs are free to use if we have a quick looking about that this is indeed running Android TV OS version 14 so go Google tv14 and you can see the kernel build numbers Etc so if I just grab my iPhone tap on cast at the bottom you can see Google TV streamer 4K if we tap on it any second now that video will cast to the big screen you can control all functions from within the phone going back to settings we're going into display and sound and if I scroll down you can see we've got HDMI C options match content dynamic range you got match content frame which is set to never but you can turn that if you need to resolution is automatic but you can see 4K 60 has been detected and it also says at the bottom there this mode also supports SDR Dolby vision hdr10 and hlg advanced display settings preferred dynamic range it's set to match content dynamic range allow game mode format selection is automatic again we can have a quick look at the formats and here are the enabled formats to confirm Doby vision hdr10 and hlg um for some reason hdr10 plus is disabled so Advanced Audio options we'll see the format supported so we've got Dolby Digital Dolby Digital plus Dolby true HD and Dolby Atmos with Dolby Digital plus disabled formats DTS dtsh HD and dtsx so that just shows you what works and what doesn't so that is pretty much all your important settings a quick look at all the apps we have installed on this box so when you're first setting up this device you'll be asked which apps you want installed so okay so so now I'm going to play some 4K video samples from a USB drive and to connect a USB drive I actually used a USB C Hub and you can see on screen exactly how that looks then we plugged in our USB 3 SanDisk Flash drive so let's begin with the usual High bit rate jellyfish demo so the first file is 160 megabits per second and you can see it's playing back fine I then played back the 180 megabit per second hybrid R jellyfish demo and unfortunately it stutters every now and then so not as smooth as I would have liked and unfortunately the 400 megabit per second jellyfish demo also failed to play back properly and straight after I tested out some 4K 60 Clips with various HDR formats and they all play back perfectly fine all right so let's just run a few tests starting off with YouTube let's try a voice search first of all 4K video and that worked fine so just to show you 4K 60 with HDR is [Music] supported and just so just to confirm in Netflix 4K Dolby vision and Dolby Atmos is supported and then I moved on to the Amazon test and you can see Amazon Prime video supports 4K HDR again with Dolby vision and Dolby Atmos supported and then I tested out Disney plus and as you guys can see this does support IMAX enhanced HD Dolby Vision with 5.1 surround sound so we're just going to do a very quick basic gaming test starting off with crossy roads [Music] now for you Advanced users DRM info shows Google wide Vine level one and here is CPU Z where you can check out the clock speeds and you can see this is running the power VR GE 9215 and that brings us to our benchmarks beginning with with geekbench single core score of 157 and multicore score of 562 and in the an2 benchmark test we achieved 135k so let's see how that compares with the others so here is my top Android TV box chart for 2024 showing you the latest TV boxes and seeing how they compare with each other and the ranking is based on anti-2 benchmark scores so higher The Benchmark faster the performance and therefore the higher the ranking but I've also given the Box a rating out of five letting you know exactly what I think of this box regardless of the high Benchmark score so as you can see the new Google TV streamer 4K takes position 11 on this chart with a benchmark score of 135k and I've also given it an overall rating of five out of five now you can read the full versions of all my charts online at chi.com and read them at your leisure and completely free of charge so there you have it guys that was the new Google TV streamer 4K and here are my thoughts Google's new streaming device is actually pretty good I experienced fast performance throughout my tests you have official Google TV version 14 with chomecast and Google Assistant all built in you have certified 4K HDR streaming across the board no stuttering or buffering issues while streaming 4K online and very good overall performance and streaming quality you're also getting a solid Wi-Fi connection and I was able to achieve my top speeds with no dropouts or any other signal issues and as a bonus you also have a gigabit Ethernet port too furthermore this does support USBC hubs for extra ports and connectivity and there are a lot of great features and everything worked exactly as it should now the only caveat to mention I wish this came with a spare USB port and also I think the device is a little bit pricey when compared to the equivalent 4K Amazon Fire TV sticks but saying that this is running official Google TV compared to Amazon's Fire TV OS and I guess that is ultimately what you're paying for now I will leave the links in the description box in case you want to check this product out for yourself and if you want to see more of my latest and greatest unbiased tech reviews hit the like button sub to the channel and

@ChigzTech,Silver,w9EbwjnpKaA,Powerful GEEKOM GT13 Pro Mini Gaming PC Review - CORE i9 (13900H) - Any Good?,what's up guys so today I've got my hands on a brand new Mini PC powered by the Intel Core I9 so this is the gecom gt13 [Music] pro now pricewise the gt13 pro is priced from 629 onwards specifications you can choose between the core i7 or the core I9 I have the topspec model here to review it's powered by the Intel Core I9 which features 14 cores 20 threads reaching clock speeds of up to 5.2 GHz turbo for graphics we have the integrated Intel Iris XE this Mini PC comes with 32 gigs of ddr5 RAM that's dual Channel 5600 MHz RAM and the configuration is 2 * 16 gigs giving you a total of 32 gigs of ddr5 RAM and that can be up upgraded to a maximum of 64 gigs now for storage we have a 2 tbte m.2 SSD drive that's a pcie Gen4 and 2 TBT is the maximum supported in that slot furthermore there is a spare m.2 2242 SSD slot so you can stick in another drive in that slot if you need to this Mini PC features Wi-Fi 6E Bluetooth 5.2 and you have a 2.5 GB Lan this is running Windows 11 professional and supports quad 4K display output now quick look at what you get inside the box so Inside the Box you will find an HDMI cable a metal vessa Mount and a bag of screws so you can mount the Mini PC on the back of your monitor this comes with a rather small compact power supply and I'll give you a closeup of the voltage information and you also get a power cable to go with it and last but not least the Mini PC itself the design Wise It's rather compact in size as you guys can see you've got this aluminium housing going all the way around and it's finished in this rather nice space gray color gecom logo engraved the back plate and the bottom are made from plastic everything else is finished in metal and I love how the corners are rounded to give you an idea of size this is my Mac Mini M2 if we just place it in one of the corners you can see how small the gecom is in comparison on the front we've got two USB 3.2 type A ports uh a headphone SL microphone combo Jack and a physical power button on the side we just got some vents on the back you've got power socket a USB 4 port on top you've got an HDMI 2.0 2.5 GB Lan we got another USB 3 we've got a USB 2 port and we have another USB 4 type-c port in that corner and another HDMI 2.0 so two HDMI ports and two USB 4 type-c ports they are USB 4 standard and they actually support up to 8K resolution so you can have two screens running at 8K at the same time or you could have all four screens running at 4K at the same time so the options are there if we keep going you got fulls siiz SD card slot and that brings us back to the front and here is a quick look at the bottom of the Mini PC we're going to check out the internals so let's remove the four sticky feet okay so now you can see four screws exposed we're just going to quickly open them up there we go so just to the right of the sticker we have a Wi-Fi antenna cable which you do not want to pull off so just be careful when you take off the lid okay so to access the internals we still need to remove more screws um I would start by removing this tape so it gives you a bit more slack to play with right four more screws by the looks of it one 2 3 4 let's remove this cover okay so we should be able to lift this off carefully right that should just come right off there's nothing connected to it which is good so here is your 2 tbte SSD drive ASA branded so Windows is installed in this drive if you swap it out you would have to reinstall Windows yourself alternatively you have a spare m.2 2242 slot over here so you can stick a fresh drive into there to give you additional space nice to have that spare slot here are your two sticks of ram so configuration 2 * 16 gigs of RAM I believe that is dual Channel Ram so you can swap these both out for 32 gigs each so giving you a maximum of 64 gigs of RAM so nice futureproof upgrades there so first of all I ran a bootup speed test and you can see on screen exactly how long it took to boot up to the Windows desktop okay so this is Windows 11 professional we're at the desktop you can see I've installed all my favorite apps and you can see a whole bunch of games I've already installed as well so this is the full version of Windows and it comes with all the usual Windows apps and youve got access to the App Store so you can download all your favorite games and apps I've already so first of all let's go ahead and check out the system properties so you can see there Windows 11 professional the processor is the 13th gen Intel Core i 9 that's the 13 900h you can see the clock speed installed RAM 32 gigs of RAM 64-bit operating system activated and ready to use use all right quick look at the system storage info we have 2 tabt of internal storage from which 1.81 tab are actually usable and I have 1.13 terabyt free to use after installing all of those big games now the second Drive you're seeing is my 64 gig flash drive which contains all my 4K samples and that is exactly what we're going to be testing next so so let's play some 4K video samples from a USB drive starting off with the usual High bit rate jellyfish samples is 160 megabits per second and you can see it's playing back with no sweat no issues at all as expected let's try the second file which is 180 megabits per second high bitrate jellyfish demo and again playing back super smooth so let's go back and try the largest sample this one is 400 megabits per second High bit rate 4K jellyfish sample and it's playing back like it's nothing so plenty of power and performance to play back high bit rate 4K videos if you need to do so also I tested some 4K samples with with different file and HDR formats and they all worked great out of the box using the default media player so I did not even have to download any codecs to make this work and while we're here I also tested out the av1 codec and you can see the video sample is playing back fine so no codex needed didn't have to install anything it worked Straight Out of the Box using the default media players which is great and here's a quick look at the display resolution you can see 3840 by 2160 is selected so screen resolution is 4K okay so we're moving on to some YouTube streaming starting off with the usual Costa Rica clip and as you guys can see YouTube does support 4K 60 with HDR [Music] [Music] this isn't done until they're dead so I tested Netflix from the web browser and it does support 4K HDR streaming with spatial audio so moving on to some gaming first game we're playing is GTA 5 I have the resolution set to 1080P and the graphics set to very high and it is 60 HZ refresh and you can see we're achieving just over 47 frames per second and you can see the TDP peeking at around 32 watts so game is playing absolutely fine pretty decent frame rates but this is a 10-year-old game so let's try something a bit more recent okay so the next game we're playing is a plague tail this game is quite graphically intense I have the resolution set to 1080P and the graphics preset is set to low and you can see we're achieving just around 20 frames per second now the lowest frame rate that I would consider playing this game would be around 30 frames per second and you could achieve this if you drop the resolution down to 720p but then you will be compromising on how the game looks okay so let's try something else so the next game we're playing is Undisputed boxing resolution set to 1080P and the graphics set to its lowest and the game plays okay at around 37 frames per second and you can see the TDP peaking at around 35 Watts if you drop down the resolution you can increase that frame rate but again this is what you can expect from the Intel Iris XC Graphics all right so now we're playing WWE 2K 24 resolution is set to 1080P and the graphics is set to standard SL low we have shadows off Reflections off and depth for field off and that's how we're able to achieve 60 frames and you can see the TDP peaking at around 33 Watts so the game is playing okay considering I have switched off many of the graphic features um if I leave those graphic features on it's a quite slow motion gameplay it's hardly playable if I switch on some of those features like shadows and Reflections and depth of field then we're achieving a much slower frame rate to the point where it's not really playable so that should give you a pretty good idea of what this Mini PC can handle gaming wise so that brings us to our benchmarks beginning with geekbench single core score of 2359 and multi core score of 11301 and in the anti-2 benchmark test we achieved 870k so let's see how this Compares with the other mini PCS of this year so this is my top Mini PC chart for 2024 allowing you to compare the price specs and features of all the other new Mini PCS reviewed this year the ranking is based on benchmark scores so looking at ant2 geekbench and PassMark I give it an average and the and the Mini PC gets ranked accordingly so as you guys can see the gecom gt13 pro has ranked at position 8 on this chart now the Intel Core I9 is of course Very powerful but the integrated Graphics do not perform on par now you can view any of my charts online at chi.com and read them at your leisure and completely free of charge there you have it guys that was the gecom gt13 pro standout features for me the core I9 performance supports quad 4K display out the form factor is nice and Compact and certainly looks smart on your desk you get plenty of connectivity with two USB four ports a 2.5 GB ethernet port cooling fan and a few upgrade options performance is very good for everyday tasks so it's great for General web browsing office applications coding graphics and some light video editing work AAA games can be played most older titles at 1080p high resolution to achieve 60 frames per second or the latest titles can be played at 1080P or even 720p um but the graphics needs to be set at the lowest Windows 11 professional comes pre-installed and ready to use and with all of that being said that's all for this video any questions you guys know what to do and if you want to see more of my latest and greatest unbias tech reviews hit the like button sub to the channel and hit the Bell icon thank you so much

now pricewise the gt13 pro is priced from 629 onwards specifications you can choose between the core i7 or the core I9 I have the topspec model here to review it's powered by the Intel Core I9 which
